**Effective Communication Webinar**, Becca Tran

## What is Communication? 

Communication is the exchange and sharing of ideas and information between two or more persons. Our organization is built upon **transparency** and learning different ways to **improve our communication skills. I**t is crucial for us to practice clear communication in ways that will help stay connected and work efficiently!

## Effective and Responsible Communication Guidelines

1. **Kindness matters**
   * Since we are going remote, there will be some misunderstanding so it is best to stay kind to everyone. You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.
2. **Express your thoughts** 
   * We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things. All ideas and thoughts are valid. 
3. **Feedback is essential** 
   * It is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
4. **1:1 are important!**
   * Asynchronous communication \(e.g., via text\) is helpful and necessary. In some cases \(e.g., to clarify misunderstandings\) it can be much more effective to jump on a Zoom video call.
5. **Everyone is a moderator** 
   * If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or People Business Partner to discuss

## Why We Document Everything

In small organizations, it's particularly tempting to avoid a documentation strategy. With only a few team members, it's feasible to keep everyone informed via meetings, Slack, or email threads. Long-term, this oversight becomes increasingly harmful.

As a team scales, the need for documentation increases in parallel with the cost of not doing it. Said another way, implementing a documentation strategy becomes more difficult ‚Äî yet more vital ‚Äî as a company ages and matures.

Documentation is rarely placed on the same pedestal with metrics such as sales and client retention during a company's formative years, but it deserves to be. The difference between a well-documented company and one that eschews a handbook is stark.

A handbook-first organization is home to team members who benefit from having a single source of truth to lean on. This type of organization is able to operate with almost supernatural efficiency. An organization that does not put concerted effort into structured documentation has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers.

## GitHub

GitHub gives you a direct path to create websites for your projects, which makes it a natural choice for publishing and maintaining documentation. Quality documentation is a hallmark of any healthy software project. Most importantly, using GitHub Pages means your documentation lives alongside your code on GitHub, where you can use things like Issues and Pull Requests to ensure it receives the high level of care it deserves. A well-curated documentation increases your project‚Äôs approachability, provides asynchronous guidance, and fosters the type of uncoordinated collaboration that propels open-source software development.

### **How to Document Meeting Notes:**

Template:

* To increase productivity + efficiency, every meeting will follow the template available on GitHub
* Team leaders will add the agenda 3 days before
* Everyone will update the agenda 1 day before the meeting
* A notetaker will be responsible to write in important points discussed into the notes
* Other attendees are encouraged to help the notetaker to participate by taking notes when they speak

###  

## Slack

Slack is our main form of communication. Files, code, information, and much more can be shared easily to members of the team through instant messaging. Multiple channels are created to communicate while having easy access to private messaging to anyone on the team.

Before making an account, you must download slack onto both your computer and mobile device. Make a slack account and join our workspace through the link below:

**Link** üëâ **\*\*\[**[https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX\*\*\]\(https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX](https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX**]%28https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX)\)

### Be respectful of your own time <a id="be-respectful-of-your-own-time"></a>

1. You should try avoid information overload in order to be productive and efficient with your time. While it can be tempting to read every message in every Slack channel you subscribe to, it‚Äôs very challenging, not expected, and not necessary.
2. One method for avoiding Slack overload is to focus your Slack reading on Starred channels and Threads. Starred channels are like "favorites" and allow you to follow messages from those channels easily. Threads consist of any conversation in which you are mentioned and allow you to easily track conversations in which you have direct involvement.
3. Use your notification settings liberally. Depending on how you use Slack this could range from limiting notifications to critical messages outside of your working hours to turning off Slack notifications entirely. Find the right balance for you and stick to it.

### Be respectful of others' time <a id="be-respectful-of-others-time"></a>

1. If you're only referring to someone, but don't actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without `@` mentioning them.
2. Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
3. Because we work globally, you may receive Slack mentions at any time of day. Please consider enabling Slack's Do not disturb functionality so you don't get interrupted, for example, in your offtime.
4. Slack does not currently support automatically activating Do Not Disturb over weekends. Please bear this in mind if you choose to work over weekends, as your Slack message to someone may interrupt their time off. Consider using another form of communication instead.
5. Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
6. Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
7. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to `@mention` a specific team \([Slack User Group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group#browse-user-groups-and-view-members)\), consider the size of the group you are mentioning  and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:
   1. Use `@here` to notify all currently _active_ members in the room. Please only use `@here` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
   2. Use `@channel` to notify _ALL_ members in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use `@channel` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
8. If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.

### General Guidelines <a id="general-guidelines"></a>

1. If the subject is of value to the wider community, consider commenting on an existing issue or opening a new issue instead on the pertinent Github Repository.
2. Use the `:white_check_mark:` emoji or similar to indicate an inquiry has been answered. Anyone can add the emoji. If you're not sure, then feel free to leave it up to the person who asked. An emoji indicator is particularly helpful in channels where lots of questions are posted, such as `#questions`, and `#git-help`.
3. In general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal \(or in Slack, written\) response might be too much.
   * Emoji Glossary \(just listing a few\)
     * ‚úÖ: "completed or approved"
     * üëç: "I agree or I understand" 
     * üëÄ: "I'll look into it"
4. In public channels, [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) are valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.
5. When and doubt please use the public channels! Rule of Thumb: **if someone can benefit from the question, post away on the public channel!**  We want to emphasize on this because it if we do not post on public channels it discourages collaboration, there would be less feedback, and it is not efficient.
6. Unless you're in an active chat, don't break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) if you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.
7. If you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to `Preferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...` and "send me email notifications."
8. If you agree in a message to start a video call \(typically by asking "Call?"\) the person that didn't leave the last comment starts the call. So either respond to the "Call?" request with a video link or say "Yes" and let the other person start it. Don't say "Yes" and start a call 5 seconds later since it is likely you'll both be creating a video call link at the same time.
9. As an admin of the Slack workspace, if given the option to _"Disable future attachments from this website"_ when removing an attachment from a message **this will blacklist the link/domain from** [**unfurling**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#unfurling-links-in-messages) **in the entire Slack workspace**. Be careful and deliberate when choosing this option as it will impact every user in the workspace.
10. When selecting your Slack display name, please do not have your name in all capital letters as this is often [associated as shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting) in written communications.

## Zoom

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is a cloud-based video conferencing platform that can be used for video conferencing meetings, audio conferencing, webinars, meeting recordings, and live chat. This video conferencing will allow us to meet and work together productively "face-to-face" when meeting in-person isn't possible. This makes meeting remotely much more human, which essential in order to help users feel and stay connected.

### General Guidelines <a id="general-guidelines"></a>

1. When the meeting first starts, you must introduce yourself to everyone, regardless if you already know them! Just like a real meeting or any social event, you don‚Äôt wanna initiate a convo between people you haven‚Äôt met. It would be pretty awk‚Ä¶.
2. Please be focused, come prepared, and stay on task. This is an extremely important guideline to keep in mind. You should understand what will be discussed in the meeting and what you will contribute to it. We want zoom calls to last from roughly 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Everyone is fairly busy so I think they can benefit everyone. However, there are exceptions, like Townhall Meetings.
3. Hybrid calls aren't it, in calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment \(camera, headset, and screen\). If we have hybrid calls, we won't be able to hear you well and you can miss on important information
4. It's okay to interrupt and put in your input. Keep to a moderate amount! We understand that when you are in a call and you want to have some input, the lag can make it seem like you are interrupting but put feel free to talk in between. We want the meetings to be more of discussion and it can improve the quality of our work. 
5. We expect you to be in an appropriate setting and wearing appropriate clothing. If you are in a loud environment, please go ahead and mute yourself. 
6. It is your own responsibly to remember what was discussed in the meeting. So takes notes if needed. 

### How Your First Meeting Will Generally Go 

1. Make a round of introductions 
2. If we plan to record the meeting, the host of the meeting will get your consent to record
3. Assign someone to take notes on GitHub
4. The host will tell you what the meeting is about and the goals 
5. Mute yourself if needed 
6. At the end, people should understand what was discussed and what your next steps are
7. Schedule another meeting if necessary 

## Calendly

[**Calendly**](https://calendly.com/) **is a simple calendar setting app.** One person makes a list of dates and times they are available, and other people go there and self-select their time. [**Calendly**](https://calendly.com/) **allows us to find the best time for 1:1 meetings. Only supervisors need Calendly and their links will be in their Slack profile.**

#### How to Set Up an Account?

1. Set up your Calendly account
2. Create a ‚Äú15 Minute Meeting‚Äù on your [Calendly account page](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me) 
   * Your new event should show up under Event Types
3.  Click the event to edit settings
4. Edit settings to match the following image:
   * Include your name in the event name
   * Location: Zoom \(add free integration\)
   * Save & Close when complete
   * Date range: indefinitely
   * Advanced settings: as per your preference
   * Add your availabilities at the bottom
     * Tip: you can add the same availabilities to multiple days by clicking and dragging over the days
   * Save & Close
   * Add two Invitee Questions:
     * Team Name
     * Supervisor
   * And make them both required fields.
     * Save & Close

\*\*\*Refer to the Bit Project Webinar \#1's deck for further instructions 

## Google Calendar 

Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service. Google Calendar allows users to create and edit events. Reminders can be enabled for events, with options available for type and time. Event locations can also be added, and other users can be invited to events. Google Calendar helps us all stay on the same schedule even with differences in time zones. **Going remote means having A LOT of virtual meetings:**

* To increase transparency, all meetings \(unless specified otherwise\) will be recorded on the Google Calendar
* All Calendly events will be linked to the Calendar
* All virtual socials will be updated on the Calendar

**If you are invited to any Google Calendar event, please RSVP as soon as possible**

### How to Use it

1:1 Meetings:

* Signing up to meet your supervisor for weekly 1:1s will automatically appear on the Google Calendar

Team/Department Meetings:

* All teams and departments are required to set up meetings through Google Calendar
  * Add event to Calendar
  * Invite all members to event
  * Include Zoom meeting link in description

## Webinar \#1: Communication 

\(insert video\) 

This is a rough outline of what was discussed in the webinar

* Slide 1: 
  * Hey everyone welcome to this first webinar. The point of Bit doing these presentations is a way to improve the organization as a whole but also improve our workflow and understanding the expectations that we have from everyone.
* Slide 2
  * Today‚Äôs main topic that we will be focusing on is Communications
* Slide 3
  * This is the content slide which is basically the agenda and you can refer back to this if needed. 
* Slide 4
  * The goal for this is to practice clear communication in a way that will help us stay connected and work efficiently as we go more remote due to the corona virus that is currently happening right now. 
  * I want to highlight that one of our biggest values our organization is built upon is transparency. Additionally, we are constantly looking for new ways to improve our communication skill. So by of these end of these webinars please let us know if you have any ideas to improve our communications
* Slide 5
  * A simple definition of the communication can be seen as an exchange between sharing of ideas and information between two or more persons
* Slide 6
  * We got inspired by GitLab and created the effective and responsible communication guidelines. So the first one being. 
    * 1. Kindness matters. We want to communicate and talk to others in a kind way and we need to be mindful of what we say. For instance, when you talk through messaging platforms you can feel like you can say anything. But just remember that if you wouldn‚Äôt say it to them in person do not send it through text! Positive vibes only in Bit! 
    * 2. Express your thoughts. We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on projects. All opinions are valid and will be taken into account for. 
    * 3. Feedback is Essential. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way. Do not be afraid to get anyone feedback but give it in a respectful way. 
    * 4. 1:1 are super important and we should implement this practice more in our communication because sometimes it is more effective to take conversation to zoom calls. Moreover, ensure that directors and members are on the same page as well as build better relationships around this organization. We always want to improve as a whole and 1:1 help us reassess Bit.
    * Everyone is a moderator. If you see something that you have concerns about please reach out to someone in a 1:1 
* Slide 7
  * Channels you should get familiar with are Slack, Calendly, zoom, Google Calendar, and GitHub. 
* Slide 8
  * First of is learning a bit about how we communicate on Slack 
* Slide 9
  * Slack is pretty easy to figure out because it user interface is really friendly so it is your responsibility to understand how to use it but we will specifically talk about the etiquette of using Slack 
  * And REMEMBER! Major decisions should not be made on slack because most likely you will forget about it and messages will get delete within 8 days
* Slide 10
  * Private Dm versus Public Channels 
  * This is a big issue that we have been having. So I cannot stress this enough but everyone needs to make an effort and start posting on Public channels more and less sending messages on private DM because it discourages collaboration, and provide less feedback
  * It is also simply not efficient because people start getting confused on who is doing what. I will provide some examples on what I mean.
  * But Rule of thumb: if an idea/question can benefit others, then post in the public channel. And if someone sends you a work-related message then let them know nicely‚Ä¶. 
* Slide 11
  * This is an example of a private DM
    * Is say someone is asking a personal questions such as ‚Äúare you going to itea‚Äù this has nothing to do with Bit so it can be used in a private DM
  * In a public channel, even when the girl is referring to a specific person it still needs to be posted on the public channel so everyone in the team is up to date with what is happening. It can be a way to keep everyone accountable.
  * We are trying to reach this quota of 55 percent of discussion should be on public channel, 25 of private channels, and 20 on private dm 
* Slide 12
  * Maybe now you are wondering what channel you should use. Each channel should have a short description on what the channel is about. If you are still confused feel free to ask a team member or your supervisor! Also please do not try to use @channel too much!
* Slide 13
  * Also, we started using an application called ‚Äúhey taco‚Äù where we can give shoutouts to people. Too often we get caught up in our work and forget to recognize each other and celebrate each other‚Äôs work. 
  * All you have to do is add a taco emoji in your message!
* Slide 14
  * Fewer Messages= Fewer Notifications 
  * I want us to work on posting your ideas/ questions in one post rather than many posts. We should practice avoiding cluttering people with notification. Getting everything you need into a single direct message means that only one notification is sent to the channel/person
  * Please be clear and concise so there are less interruptions 
* Slide 15
  * Here is an example of cluttering. There are 10 notifications rather it can be condensed into 2 or 3 notifications or messages. When there are a lot of pings it can be overwhelming and distracting to people in the channel. So please be mindful when sending messages.  
* Slide 16
  * Another thing we can do to avoid cluttering is using threads. Members can talk without tripping the unread indicator for everyone else in the channel. Meaning not everyone in the channel will get a notification. It allows for an ongoing conversation while keeping the main channel clear. But if you want people to know what you are talking about in the thread you can check the box below your message to post to the entire channel. This is a way for us to be mindful!
* Slide 17 
  * Here a quick example of us using a thread. And you can see that even though it was just us setting up a zoom meeting we still posted it in the public while not cluttering the chat by using the thread. 
* Slide 18
  * This is more of a tip but you can replace short follow-up messages with emoji reactions. Here is just a short emoji glossary.
    * The check mark can be translated as completed or approved
    * The thumbs up can mean i agree or understand 
    * Or the heart emoji can mean I love it!
* Slide 19
  * We understand that you are busy, but please remember to respond whenever you can! It would be really efficient if you guys can respond within 24 hours. Also if you guys are busy for a certain amount of time please tell your director that you are busy in a private message. 
* Slide 20
  * Take some conversation face to face. What I mean is that some conversations are super technical so it would be more time-efficient if you take your conversation to zoom. This means less miscommunication! Remember that Slack can never replace face to face interaction where people can always connect better. 
* Slide 21 
  * Next up is Zoom 
* Slide 22
  * Please learn how to use it on your own time. But it is pretty simple!
* Slide 23
  * Everyone from now on needs to introduce themselves at the beginning. Just like a real meeting or any social event, you don‚Äôt wanna initiate a convo between people you haven‚Äôt met. It would be pretty awk. So let your members know who you are!
  * Also just some quick tips. Please hold your meeting in a work-appropriate backgrounds and mute yourself if needed
* Slide 24
  * We like to document our meetings because some people who could not go to the meeting can catch up.
  * We will ask for your consent to record the meeting first so please make sure your camera is on. These videos are only going to be used for us and they won‚Äôt be posted. 
  * If you are uncomfortable with this please let me or shreya know and leave the zoom call quietly.  
* Slide 25
  * We expect that everyone should come to the meeting prepared and stay on task 
  * Make sure you guys understand what the meeting is about and what deliverables you need to complete before the meeting 
  * We only want zoom calls to last around 30-90 mins however there are some exceptions 
* Slide 26
  * We do not allow Hybrid Calls because we want to be as professional as we can. Hybrid calls are when two or more persons are using the same camera, headset, and screen. In Bit everyone should have their own because we won't be able to hear you well, and we can miss on important conversations, and we won't be able to tell who is talking. So please use you own equipments 
* Slide 27
  * In a Zoom meeting it is okay in Interrupt the speaker! I know that when you are in a call and you want to have some input, the lag can make it seem like you are interrupting but feel free to talk in between. We want the meetings to be more of a discussion, as it improves the quality of our work. But please be mindful of how many times you are interrupting because it can make the discussion longer than necessary. 
* Slide 28
  * This is the general process of how our Zoom calls can go
* Slide 29
  * Next is Calendly
* Slide 30
  * Calendly allows us to find the best time for 1:1 meetings
  * You are expected to meet with your supervisor once a week for about 15 minutes. And you can use calendly to schedule that. All supervisor will have their calendly in their slack descriptions  
* Slide 31
  * Google Calendar
* Slide 32
  * Why are we using google calendar?
    * For the reasons that it helps us all stay on the same schedule even when we all live in different time zones. Because as we go more and more remote there will be a good amount of virtual meetings. Having google calendar will increase one of values which is transparency.
    * All calendly events will be linked to the calendar 
    * Socials will be on the calendar as well
    * You should receive an invite in your second email to get access to our calendar
* Slide 33 
  * How will we use it
    * Again 1:1 meetings will be recorded on there 
  * Team/ department meetings will be on there
    * To set it up 
    * 1. Add the event to calendar
    * 2. Invite all the members
    * 3. Include the zoom link in the description 
* Slide 34
  * GitHub is the platform where we will take our meetings notes. There be another webinar that goes into depth about this
* Slide 35 
  * We document notes based on three main things
    * Availability 
    * Accountability
    * Readability
* Slide 36 
  * How to document the meeting notes
* Slide 37
  * Example
* Slide 38
  * Thanks!
