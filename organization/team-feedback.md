# Team Feedback

**Team Feedback Webinar,** Jasmine Cheng

## Goal

The goal of this webinar is learn what ways the People team will do with your feedback to positively influence the organization, as well as teach you how to learn how to give feedback to others. 

Feedback is vital in any organization. We need to understand that constructive feedback is a robust tool for creating a healthy environment, boosting productivity and engagement and achieving better results. 

## Importance of feedback

* Keeps everyone on track
* Helps avoid major mistakes
* Form better relationships
* Promotes personal and professional growth
* Motivates people 
* Enable a healthy work environment

## Feedback Guidelines

#### 1. Reflect on Your Purpose

Feedback should come from the right place. If we are mindful, we can come to discussions from a place of care. Right reasons to give feedback include having commitment/concern for others, having a sense of responsibility, guiding/mentoring others, and supporting others. Wrong reasons to give feedback include defending your own behavior, demoralizing/condemning others, if you are in a sour mood, to appease a third part, or to make yourself seem superior/powerful. 

#### 2. Focus on the Behavior, not the Person

Why? Because it separates the problematic situation from the person’s identity. Enter in discussion with your best intentions. Separate behavior or actions from the person you are speaking to.

#### 3. Lead with Questions

Starting off your feedback with a few questions can help the other person feel like an equal part in the conversation as you discuss the challenge together

#### 4. Cultivate a Growth Mindset

View feedback as an opportunity for improvement. A growth mindset has the tendency to embrace challenges and… 

* Persist in the face of setbacks
* Sees effort as the path to mastery
* Learns from criticism 
* Finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others 

Which leads them to high levels of achievement!

#### **5. Value to Feedback Process**

* Approach things in a positive and optimistic way 
* Do not criticize or condemn team members 
* Never complain 
* Be deliberate about giving genuine appreciation
* Have focus on self improvement

### **Who can I give feedback to and when?**

It does not matter what level they are, or whether you are in different teams, you can give feedback to anyone! They can be supervisors, managers, directors, peers and colleagues, or members in other teams.

You can provide feedback all the time! 

1. When you want something to **change**
2. When you want something to **continue**
3. When you are doing something **wrong**
4. When you are doing something **right** 

## Tips on how to give feedback

#### Suggestion, not criticism

Suggestions are more positive, helpful, and an instrument for improvement. Criticism is often not the way to go if you want: 

1. For your colleagues to improve
2. See actual changes
3. Contribute to meaningful discussions

You can start off your sentences with "I'd love it if.." or "I think you would do a great job with…” or "One thing that could make this webinar even better is…”.

#### **Choose an Appropriate Time and Place**

* Do not bottle it up. Give feedback ASAP and at a practical time
* Allow enough time so you are not rushed 
* Do not give feedback in “public” 
  * E.g Slack public channel 
* Consider all parties’ schedule 

#### **How to schedule a feedback meeting**

Your slack message could say:

Hey, could we meet sometime to talk about our latest projects. I have some ideas in ways that we could improve. I think there was some miscommunication. Could we hop on a Zoom call tomorrow?

#### **Give Feedback Face-to Face**

* Face-to-face feedback conversations are ‘two-way’ \(rather than feedback in an slack or email\) 
* Be aware of your/their body language 
  * EX: you can nod to show that you understand 
* Choose your words carefully to reduce the chance of being misunderstood 

#### **Ask for Feedback**

You can ask for feedback often, especially from those you trust because you’ll be better able to see any challenges ahead of time, and you’ll gain experience in responding positively to feedback**.**

#### **Be Specific**

Members should know exactly what aspect of the project you’re talking about, what they did wrong, and how it can be improved.

“I would love it if you check-in with me from time to time about the project”.

“I would appreciate if you started to ask more questions in the public channel rather than privately dming me because I think the team can benefit from your ideas".

## Feedback Planning Process

#### Prepare

* Review your notes on what you want to say
* Make sure you have specific examples 
* Let the issue out in one sentence in your mind

#### Share

Start with an opening statement:

“Thanks for meeting me. I appreciate you taking the time to talk about this situation. I’d like to share my observations and then invite you to respond. How does that sound?”

Share your motive**:**

“The reason why I’d like to bring this up is because I think if we talk about it now, it will help improve the quality of our working relationship”

Reference the facts/examples:

“Two weeks ago we met and agreed that you would complete this webinar last week on Friday and I noticed that you did not finish it.”   


#### Ask

1. ****Invite them to reply - “Do you have any comments so far about what I said?".

2. Ask one open-ended questions to get the conversation started - "What can you share with me about this?"

3. Stay silent and allow them time to respond  

#### Listen

* When asking the member a question, the next best thing you can do is be quiet and let them respond 
* Pay attention to their words, tone, voice, and body language
* Guide and question them and help them discover their own answers 
  * “What do you think happened”
  * “Can you expand on that”
  * “How would you summarize the situation”
  * “Tell me more”
  * “Share with me the specific details” 

#### Action

* Discuss constraints, problem areas, or needed areas of improvement  
  * “I would like your help in solving this issue on GitHub. What ideas do you have?”
* Treat it as a conversation and the goal of this is to get a better understanding
* Ask them to commit to specific actions, results, and timeframes  

  * “Let’s plan to touch base one week from today. How does that sound?”

**Praise**

* Share potential you see in them that they might not see in themselves
  * “I know you have the ability to move forward from this issue that we face. I believe you can overcome this!” 
* Thank them and remind them how valuable they are 

  * “Thank you for joining in this conversation with me, you are doing great in Bit!”

#### Hold People Accountable

* Decide who is going to do what, by when, follow up and DOCUMENT
  * Make sure all parties agree on the actionable items and document it on GitHub 
* Touch base with people
  * Check in with their work and have your normal regular 1:1 meetings if needed 
* Offer ongoing support and positive reinforcement
  * Send shout-outs using “Hey Taco”!

**Where to Go From Here...**

* Build a habit. Continue the art of feedback 
* Be mindful of giving feedback… all the time!
* Set an example. Be a mentor to other members!
  * What feedback you give to others make sure you follow it yourself
* Make feedback a part of who you are and what you do. It will help you in the future!

## **How is Bit Involved and How Will You Participate?**

#### **Gather Feedback Anonymously**

Beginning of the quarter as well as the end of the quarter, we will have a survey to assess what we can do improve this organization. We expect everyone to answer this form.

We also have Town Halls, or a big meeting where everyone in the organization is required to attend. Before the Town Hall we send a form \(Retroly\) where people give feedback anonymously and the directors/supervisor/ managers address them. Feel free to give us feedback.

#### **Discuss with your team**

Periodic Meetings:

When you complete your project. There should be a meeting with everyone on that team to discuss what went well and what could have been done better. 

Always remember to document this on GitHub!

**Working with the People Team**

We are here to help assist you and help you give feedback. So feel free to ask us any questions! ****Also our People Experience Associate will routinely visit each team, find solutions to smoothen any issues that may arise, and take down any of your feedback.

People Team will work with teams to help improve the workflow. We will be involved in your meetings on the side to assess how to help the team as a whole. This allows us to be a third party.
