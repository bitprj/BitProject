# Diversity & Inclusion

## **What is Diversity?** 

**Diversity** is the variation of individuals of society that represent different social backgrounds such as culture, race, class , gender, sexuality, etc. Diversity entails that every individual is unique and different from one another while also embracing acceptance and respect. 

## **What is Inclusion?**

In the workplace, **inclusion** is the state of making sure every member is involved and treated fairly. Inclusion encompasses respect within the organization and gives equal opportunities between members. 

## **Why is Diversity and Inclusion Important to Bit Project?**

First, it is our pledge that we treat all members and contributors with respect to create a community that is a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of their social background. 

Second, Bit Project is furthering their path towards online platforms. Online communication will increase as we go remote. This can lead to miscommunication, misconduct, and social or professional conflicts. We want to  encourage a safe and healthy work environment among members. 

## Who Do You Identify As? 

A **social identity** is how an individual identifies them self among other members in society. These social identities include culture, religion, class, ability, race/ethnicity, occupation, education, age, sexuality, gender and more. In Bit Project, there are many individuals who identify as different social groups that have come together to foster a new learning environment that is always teaching each other new ideas and values. 



**Since many members identify and come from different social groups, here are some three important reminders to always follow** 

1. Do not assume _sameness -_  When most individuals meet other people, they assume that they have been raised with the same expectations and share the same experiences. However,  this is not the case. People are raised differently and conform to different lifestyles based on their social identities. For example, let's discuss about socioeconomic status. During a boba social, a team member mentions that they will not buy anything because they are saving up on funds. Another member states that "boba is only $4". This member is assuming _sameness_ by believing that boba is affordable for everyone and did not consider their teammates situation. 
2. _Normal_ or _traditional_  behavior is different within social groups - Everyone in Bit Project comes from a different background and has adapted to their own cultural traditions and etiquette. Every culture and social group has their own set of norms, which can cause the individual to have a limited lens. This can cause an individual to look at other practices and traditions as abnormal. Since there are many individuals from different backgrounds, it is imperative for members to broaden their cultural lens and learn/meet others to create a safe and healthy working environment. 
3. If you see something wrong, help _improve_ the situation - In order to maintain a healthy and safe environment, members must refrain from making inappropriate comments. If you hear a member make an inappropriate comment, communicate with them and tell them why what they said was wrong. 

## What is the difference between _equality_ and _equity_?

**Equality** means _equal_  levels of opportunity and _same_ levels of support. It is a way to promote fairness and puts every individual on the same pedestal. 

**Equity** considers each _individual's needs_ in order to provide support. It looks into each individual's social background and eliminates barriers that has prohibited members from participating. 

## Why is Equality Important to Us?

Many members of Bit Project identify with different **social groups**.

Treating members with **equality** will 

* [ ] prevent discrimination and bullying
* [ ] give all members equal opportunities of improving skills
* [ ] includes all perspectives in conversations and work 
* [ ] build _loyalty,_ _trust_ and _respect_

**It is imperative that you treat every single member equally in organization and with people in the outside world.**

## **Why is Equity Important to Us?**

As Bit Project grows, we encounter more people from **different backgrounds** and experiences. We need to **support** each other by **sharing resources** and understanding that every individual has their own **distinct set of needs** to succeed.

Remember that 

* [ ] Everyone works at a different pace
* [ ] Everyone has priorities like family and health that they need to focus on
* [ ] Everyone has a **unique skill set** to offer

## Importance of Bias and Confidentiality

### Fundamental Attribution Error 

When there is conflict, we tend to attribute the other party’s behavior to their **personality** \(what “kind” of person they are\) rather than less obvious **situational factors.** People may also use **stereotypes** to explain behavior**.**

For example, as a member of Bit Project, you will be attending multiple meetings and work sessions. A member may be late or not attend at all without notice. This causes another member to immediately judge them by believing that they are sloppy and disorganized. This member did not consider any situational factors such as family, class, or traffic. This is a dangerous mindset as it can create conflict within the team. 

### Confidentiality 

Confidentiality helps build trust and and form strong relationships within Bit Project and those in the outside world. It also prevents conflicts and rumors created within the organization. 

Members must not disclose sensitive information to an outside party unless granted permission. 

**What counts as sensitive information includes but is not limited to:**

* [ ] Domestic abuse matters
* [ ] Family situations 
* [ ] Academic information such as financial aid and GPA
* [ ] Financial situation 
* [ ] Relationships with other people 
* [ ] Social identities such as sexuality, class, age, ability, etc. 

## Policies to Practice

**Be aware of** _**pronouns**_ **and respect every individual's identity.**

* [ ] Check Slack bios for pronouns 
* [ ] Using pronouns validates a person's identity and creates an inclusive environment
* [ ] Misgendering means disrespect 

**Welcome and get to know new members and coworkers during socials and work sessions** 

* [ ] Getting to know new members promotes an inclusive environment and makes them feel welcomed and safe 

**Do not openly discuss someone else's personal life during work. If someone wanted to discuss their personal matters, they will bring it up.**

* [ ] Work sessions should be focused on completing projects 
* [ ] You are violating confidentiality rights when the individual is not present
* [ ] People may not feel comfortable to tell you to stop, so do not assume that it is okay to discuss their personal matters openly

**Do not ask inappropriate questions during work.** 

* [ ] You can make the other party feel violated and uncomfortable 
* [ ] These inappropriate topics include but are not limited to
  * [ ] Significant relationships 
  * [ ] Life decisions 
  * [ ] Personal academic conditions 
  * [ ] Social identities such as sexuality, socioeconomic class, ability, gender,  and more

**Do not make generalizations or use stereotypes to talk about another person.**

* [ ] This denies work opportunities to members if you treat them as a stereotype of their social identity 
* [ ] Harmful and alienates individuals 
* [ ] Threatens a healthy and diverse work environment
