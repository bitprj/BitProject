# 24 Hour Rule

## Why do we have this rule?

Due to past miscommunications issues, Bit Project will be enforcing a 24 hour rule for communication between all members of Bit. It is expected that as a team member, you are to respond to all messages within 24 hours, unless youâ€™ve clearly communicated that you will be unavailable for the next few days for academic or personal reasons to your director or manager. Not only will this increase communication and awareness, but also avoid mishaps in the project scope. Many of our projects are time-sensitive and with one member not in the loop of the conversation, it will delay the entire team, depriving your peers a meaningful and learning experience within Bit. **To clarify, it is completely acceptable--encouraged even--to let your managers/directors know that you have a busy few days because of school or other reasons**. Therefore, please keep in mind to notify your director or manager.

## Who will enforce this rule?

In terms of the process, the managers will be overseeing this rule. If a member does not reply to other members within 24 hours, they will receive one strike from the manager. With 3 strikes, the member will unfortunately be offboarded from Bit Project by the manager. Offboarding indicates that you are no longer part of Bit Project. The managers will notify you with every strike you receive. After every strike, the manager will reach out to the member for a 1:1 to understand the situation and context for your absent communication. We understand that life can be extremely complicated and there are other responsibilities present. All we ask is for a two-way communication. This initiative is meant to promote collaboration, communication, and understanding.
