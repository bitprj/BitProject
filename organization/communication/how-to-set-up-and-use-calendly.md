# How to Set Up and Use Calendly

Calendly is a platform that allows you to invite others to schedule meeting times based on your availability. Once the time is confirmed, Calendly sends a meeting invite directly to your calendar. At Bit Project, we'll be using Calendly to mainly schedule one-on-one meetings.

## Getting Started

These 1:1 meetings should be relatively short so I suggest having only 15 or 30 minute meetings.

## Integrating Zoom into your Meetings

#### 1. Click on 15 minute meeting and click on "What event is this?"
