## Taking Meeting Notes

### Step 2: Check off Agenda

The "Agenda" section contains a checklist of things you should do 3 day or 1 day prior to the meeting and at the beginning of the meeting. 

As you finish every step listed in the "Agenda" section, replace the space in \[ \] by putting an "x" in the \[ \]. This checks off the corresponding step.

### Step 3: Fill in Updates

During the meeting, you should ask your team members for updates on their tasks. Updates can be tasks that have been completed and can be checked off, or tasks that are still in progress. 

As you get updates from your team during the meeting, fill in the "Updates" section by replacing "Update 1" with your first update.

If you have more than 1 updates, follow the "\*  Update1" format in the next line for subsequent updates.
