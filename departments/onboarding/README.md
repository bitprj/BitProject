### Difference between Onboarding 1:1 and Weekly 1:1 Meeting

The Objective of the **Onboarding 1:1 Meeting** is to have the new member learning about the team and have them staying aligned with other team members as soon as possible.   
During the meeting managers will:

1. Introduce the team to the new member, including the project they are working on currently, and any specific rule the new member needs to know.
2. Run through the expectations, goals and workflow with the new member.
3. Introduce the responsibilities for new members after onboarding.
4. Answer any questions new members might have & receive any feedback.

The Objective of the **Weekly 1:1 Meeting** is to build a trusting relationship and stay informed and aligned with each other.   
Especially since we are a remote club that has different students across the nation, it is extremely important that:

* We are able to share our ideas and concerns.
* Ensure that we remain on the same page.
* Stay engaged and meet our goals.
* Have the opportunity to work together to find ways to be more successful. 

During the weekly 1:1 Meeting:

1. Discuss any accomplishment after last met.
2. Talk about feelings about the work, satisfying and frustrations.
3. Providing mutual feedback to help each other grow.
4. Discuss any issues and obstacles noticed & solutions
