# Workshops: Choosing Your Idea

Please ensure you **completely confirm your idea** before moving on with this process.

## Week 1 of 3: Getting Ideas on \(MDX-Deck\) Paper

**Setting up MDX-Deck:**

Please set up your MDX-Deck workspace on Code Sandbox. Follow the guide [here](https://about.bitproject.org/teams/developer-relations/setting-up-code-sandbox).

**Week 1 Checklist**

* [ ] Have Code Sandbox completely set-up
* [ ] Go through entire workshop
  * [ ] Make sure it **completely works on your computer**\* _\*\*_
  * [ ] Understand at a high level what is happening
* [ ] Convert workshop idea into MDX-Deck Slides on bitprj/mdx-deck
  * [ ] Make speaker notes for all slides
* [ ] Add new interactive component
* [ ] Finalize date and time with Head
* [ ] ["General Slide Checklist"](./#general-slide-checklist) should be completed for your slides

_\*Some workshops may be outdated or incomplete. It would be up to you to coordinate with your manager to fill in the gaps._

Each duo should first convert each workshop article into slides. Detailed speaker notes should be made for all slides.

Then you should consult with your manager to formulate and come together on an idea for your new interactive component. This idea should be fully addressed in your MDX-Deck slides.

Lastly, for planning purposes, the date and time of your presentation should be finalized with the Head of DevRel.

## Week 2 of 3: Finalizing Materials

* [ ] Finalize slides per manager's feedback
* [ ] Convert slides into lab format
* [ ] Prepare presentation
  * [ ] Finalize speaker notes
  * [ ] Confirm date and time with Head
* [ ] ["General Slide Checklist"](./#general-slide-checklist) should be completed for your slides

As developers, you should fully integrate your manager's feedback on your slides for this week. While finalizing your slides, you should also convert these slides into a lab format. Please consult with your manager closely on both the slides and the lab conversion during meetings/follow-ups.

Lastly, for the presentation, speaker notes should be fully fleshed out in MDX-Deck. Please confirm your presentation time with your manager and head.

## Week 3 of 3: Presentation, Implementing Feedback

If you are a **designated duo,** please note that in place of the Zoom Presentation, you will conduct a _dry run_ in front of your head and manager. Designated duos will have their workshop **marketed** to numerous technical communities, meet-ups and organizations, and their final presentation will be on a predetermined date after this week. Our design team and marketing team will put great care and time to marketing this workshop!

 Otherwise, you will conduct a normal Zoom presentation, to all members of Bit.

* [ ] Conduct Zoom Presentation
* [ ] Integrate all Feedback on Slides, Lab and Presentation

In the final week, you will present your workshop to all members of Bit, and to the general public. After your presentation, you should work to integrate all feedback on your slides, lab and presentation by the end of the week.

Then the cycle starts anew!
