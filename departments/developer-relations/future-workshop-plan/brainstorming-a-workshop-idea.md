# Brainstorming a Workshop Idea

With the rapid advancements in industrial applications of software engineering and software developers, it has become necessary that teaching and learning methods are also updated in a way that will help students both in theory and practical industry applications. \(Extra\)

The structure of our workshops will focus on understanding fundamental concepts of modern software development and use those concepts in projects. Before building an application, it is important to understand some important the basic tools and how they can be used. Your team should work on using the provided libraries creatively and affectively. The workshops will be divided into five categories. Each category is a project on its own dives into specific fields such as:

* Web Development \(Django, Flask,socket\)
* Data science/visualization \( Matplotlib, Seaborn\),
* Desktop GUI \(Tkinter, PyQt\)
* Web scraping \(Selenium, BeautifulSoup\)
* Game Development \(pygame, PySoy\)

Since projects will emphasis on building products or services that can have real-life applications. Some examples, are:

* Financial Applications:
  * A stock market watching app
* Information app:
  * Build a 1-page news app, that gets the top stories from 3 favorite technology newspapers.
* Healthcare:
  * Build an only doctor to patient video call app.
* Social Media:
  * Chat application.
* Security:
  * Deep fake image detector

Your team is not required to finish the whole project during the workshop. The goal of these workshops is for students to be able to use the libraries and frameworks to develop a basic representation of their idea but more importantly to be able to recreate the basic concepts of those ideas in the respective category they choose. If students have an ambitious goal, our goal is to break the idea down into the first basic presentable form of the idea.
