# Introduction To ML with Sci-Kit Learn

Learning Objectives‌

* Introduce the Sci-Kit Learn\(SKLearn\) library for Python.
* Learn how to use the SKLearn library to analyze sentiment.
* Learn how to convert strings into vectors for ML use.
* Learn how to convert strings into colorized vectors for ML use.
* Learn about Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression\(within the context of ML\).
* Learn how to analyze results \(from a ML application\).
* Learn how to find hyper parameters that work best with our model.
* Learn how to save models using the Pickle library.
