# Learning & Development Manager

## Description

The Learning & Development Manager is responsible for ensuring that people within the organization have access to resources that will help them succeed professionally and socially. They identify training needs within the organization, and use their findings to produce high scalable training programs to support the learning of all individuals within the organization. Additionally, they present the training material to large-scale audiences. They help unlock member potential and enable each individual to grow in their current role.

They will also work with Learning & Development Associates to push out these training programs.

## Success Metrics

### Measuring growth of skills through assessments

Prior to showing a series of videos to a team member, the L&D manager will send out a short quiz to access their current knowledge on the subject. After the training is complete, there will be a follow up quiz that tests how well they have learned the material. This will allow the manager to assess how useful the training program was.

### Member Productivity

After a team member has reviewed the training materials, their Director will review their overall performance and report back to the L&D manager on how much more productive they were. 

### Percentage of members that get promoted to leadership positions 

A large chunk of our training materials is for current team members to have the skills necessary to be a manager of a director. If the L&D manager notices that not a lot of people are being promoted, they may have to adjust their approach.

### Collecting feedback

After releasing a training program, the L&D manager will need to collect feedback from the team member that went through the program. That way, they can improve on the next set of programs they create for future members.
