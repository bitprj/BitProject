# Underperformance Guidelines

## What does "underperforming" mean?

At Bit Project, we care a lot about meeting objectives and key results \(OKRs\). The President will set OKRs for Directors, Directors for Managers, and Managers for their team members. These OKRs will depend on the team and the position that you are in. If you are not consistently meeting these OKRs, then you are underperforming. The duration of the performance improvement period and the details of the plan will be discussed on a case by case basis.

 Consistently not meeting OKRs = Underperforming
