# How we track the team's OKRs

## Overview

Every Friday, the Learning and Development team will be checking the status of assigned OKRs. Even though we will be enforcing these rules, managers and directors will be responsible for ensuring that their team members are meeting the OKRs that they have set for them.

### Collecting Data and Insights

During our review on Fridays, we will review all OKRs and calculate the percentage of completed OKRs. There will be a total of four reports, one for each team: Engineering, Developer Relations, People, and Marketing. For each team, we will break down percentages into four categories: Director's OKRs, all Manager's OKRs, all team member's OKRs, and the entire's team's OKRs. These reports will be sent out to the President and the respective Director by Saturday at the latest. For each missed OKR, we will write suggestions on how to better achieve it next time. 

### Setting up meetings with L&D

If we consistently notice that a certain Director, Manager, or team member is underperforming, we will have them go through underperformance training to bring them back on track.

## What we ask of Directors and Managers

Directors are responsible for ensuring that Managers are meeting their OKRs. Managers are responsible for ensuring that their team members are meeting their OKRs. If the individuals they are watching over are not meeting their OKRs, it is the their responsibility to set up 1:1 meetings with them to discuss their performance. The goal is for Directors and Managers to identify underperforming members before the Learning and Development team does.

We also ask that Directors and Managers assign weekly OKRs that are reasonable. If your assignee has mentioned that she/he has a lot on their plate for that week, please work with them to adjust their OKRs. There is no benefit to creating OKRs that cannot be achieved.
