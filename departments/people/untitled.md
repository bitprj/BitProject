# Filing Diversity & Inclusion Reports

**As part of the onboarding process you'll watch a** [**Diversity and Inclusion Webinar**](https://youtu.be/dIvSjM-1Phw) **that explains the concepts behind diversity and inclusion and why they are significant within Bit Project.**

It's important that all members, directors, and managers follow our diversity and inclusion guidelines as we maintain a supportive and remote workplace.

If at any point during your time at Bit Project you feel uncomfortable or unsafe because of something someone did or said, please report the incident to us [here](https://airtable.com/shrX3yME3IV1vUjFx).

* You may choose to submit your report anonymously, but please know that you are safe from any form of retaliation if you provide your name.
* We take every report received seriously. After you submit a report using the Airtable form, we will conduct an investigation and take the appropriate actions.

You may also use the [form](https://airtable.com/shrX3yME3IV1vUjFx) to provide suggestions on how we can make Bit Project more diverse and inclusive.
