# How to Set Up a Virtual Event

## **Project Planning**

Once the speakers and webcast dates are secured, the webcast project is officially in motion. The marketing programs team will immediately:

1. Create the necessary Github issue in the Marketing Repo
2. Ensure the webcast Dry Run and Live dates are added to the Virtual Events Google Calendar by sending over a Gcal invite from there to the Virtual Events execution team. _**Note: This is an important step to make sure no overlapping webcasts/meeting are scheduled over the desired webcast and dry run date/timeslot resulting in a conflict due to the shared webcast@ license.**_
3. Coordinate with requestor/campaign owner \(if different from requestor\) to set up a kick off call with the external speakers. You can use your zoom accoount or the requestor's/campaign manager's zoom account \(not the webcast@ one\) for this.

## Best Practices

1. Give yourself at least 30 business days of promotion.
2. Send invitation emails 2 weeks out, 1 week out, and if needed 2 hours before event. Sample emails can be found here.
3. Only send promotional emails Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday for optimal results.
4. Send reminder emails to registrants the day before, and one hour before the event.
5. Host webcasts on a Wednesday or Thursday, see note below about scheduling.
6. Post links to additional, related resources during the event.
7. Include "contact us" information and a clear CTA at the end of the presentation.
8. Video recording of webcast uploaded to YouTube within 24 hours as event occurred.
9. Send the recording to all registrants, whether they attended or not within 48 hours post webcast.
10. Review Zoom's guide on [in person chat](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203650445-In-Meeting-Chat) which explains the various ways you can utilize the chat feature

## Speaker Approval

Marketing Programs sometimes depend on Bit Project subject matter experts to deliver webcast presentations. However, we must ensure that when we ask a speaker to participate on a webcast that the work is approved. Please use the following guideline when asking a subject matter expert to participate on a webcast.

1. Have a high-level abstract of the content prepared before asking for a presenter.
2. Send the abstract to both the proposed speaker and their manager to review. A speaker is not considered booked unless they have approval from their manager.
3. Address and resolve any concerns regarding the abstract.
4. Once the manager approves and the speaker accepts, you can move forward with the webcast.

## **Tips for Speakers**

Here are some basic tips to help ensure that you have a good experience preparing for and presenting on a webcast.

**Before Committing**

Ask us any questions you have about the time commitment etc. and what exactly our expectations are. Talk about it with your manager if you're on the fence about your availability, bandwidth, or interest. Make sure you're both on the same page. We want this to be a meaningful professional development exercise for you, not a favor to us that you're lukewarm about â€” if you feel that way, none of will be able to do our best job. We'll be honest with you, so please do the same for us.

**Before the Dry Run**

Select and set up your presentation space. Pick a spot with good wifi, and we recommend setting up an external mic for better audio quality, although this is optional. If you will be presenting from your home, alert your spouse/roommates of the time/date & ask them to be out of the house if necessary. Depending on your preferences and comfort level with public speaking, run through the script several times.

**Before the Presentation**

Try to get a good sleep the night before, and, if the presentation is in the morning, wake up early enough to run through your notes at least once. Review our [Positioning FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/positioning-faq/), or keep the page handy in case you are asked in the Q&A about how GitLab compares to our competitors.
