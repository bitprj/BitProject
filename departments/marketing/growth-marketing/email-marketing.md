# Email Marketing

## Best Practices

**Content**

* Email copy should be shorter and more conversion-oriented
* Avoid walls of text when possible
* Use extremely clear wording and remove words that don't provide value
* Minimize CTAs \(calls-to-action\)
* Take advantage of content hierarchy
* Use humor when it makes sense
* Craft compelling subject lines and employ the preview text as a complement to the subject line
* Focus on value-first content and CTAs. Ask yourself: "what's in it for the subscriber?"

**Design**

* Consider responsive design
* Code all text in HTML
* Minimize CTAs
* Images should add to the goal of your email and not take away from it
* An email is not a landing page
* Consider accessibility

**A/B Testing**

* Each test group should include at least 1000 people
* You need a bigger test group if you're testing for click-through rate versus testing for open rate
* Have a goal and idea regarding what you want to improve and how your test is going to help with that
* Test _one_ variable at a time
* Due to our small sample sizes, we recommend a full 50/50 split versus a 10/10/80 or 20/20/60 split
* Remember your subject line or "from name" \(testing open rates\) could have an impact on click-through rate and conversion rate
* Let the MPM know at the beginning of the project if you're interested in running an A/B test and what your goals/hypothesis is
* Keep track of the split test learnings so we can learn and innovate!



## **Need-to-know details for the email request**

Below are the information from the issue template that will need to be filled out before the MPM will create the email in the appropriate system:

* **Sender Name**: Typically we use team@bitproject.org for most outgoing communications. Choosing a sender name that is consistent with the type and/or content of email being sent is important, if unsure make a note and we will make recommendation.
* **Sender Email Address**: What email address should be used?
* **Approvers**: All approvers must be listed on the email request. At least one individual who will receive the replies to the email must be listed an as approver. For example, if the email is coming from security@, someone who will receive replies to the email should be listed as one of the approvers. See approval table below.
* **Subject Line**: 50 character max is preferred \(30-40 characters for mobile devices\)
* **Email Body Copy**: Can be a text snippet within issue, clearly identified comment on issue or attach a Google Doc with copy. The copy must be approved before requesting the email.
* **Target Date to Send Email**: at a minimum a few days notice is preferred because we need to balancing the number of emails being sent to our database so they are not perceived \(or marked\) as spam; however, a simple email can be turned in a few hours if absolutely necessary
* **Recipient List**: Emails can be sent to one of the **existing segments on Hubspot** or a recipient list can be provided as a .csv file
  * Audience should be appropriately segmented and tokens selected for personalization \(if applicable\)
  * All subscribers are selected list are opted-in to receive your message
  * If supplying a .csv file, the file must include the following fields: Email address, First Name \(or Full Name\)
  * If personalizing the email to reference a specific project or page, that field must be included in the .csv file and clearly marked using the same terminology used in the email copy. The email copy must clearly identify {{Project}} or {{Page}} where the applicable personalization should be inserted.



## **Types of email requests**

* **Marketing Emails**: Marketing emails are designed to generate leads. The request process outlined is used for ad-hoc marketing emails \(not events, webcasts, integrated campaigns, etc as these all have a separate established process\). These emails are sent through HubSpot using the marketing database or [existing segments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#geographic-dma-list).
* **Support emails**: Support emails are typically sent to a subset of impacted users and are not marketing-related. These emails are sent through MailChimp.
