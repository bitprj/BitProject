# Postman

### What is Postman?

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. This tool is very useful to test out routes that the Backend Engineers make. So if a component needs to pull data from the backend, the Frontend Engineers can test the route that they need before coding out the API call.

This guide will show you how to get Postman set up and how to import the Backend Engineer's routes.

### Installing Postman Client

### How to find specific routes

You can now click on the Bit-Backend folder and you will see other folders as well. Each folder contains routes that correlate to the name of the folder name. For example, the Activities folder contains routes that relate to Activities.
