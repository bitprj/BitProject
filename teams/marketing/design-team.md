# Design Team

## Our Workflow

Bit Project Content Creators work with all departments within the organization to design and produce original, high quality content that can be used in for branding and marketing.

### Departments:

#### Marketing:

#### Developer Relations:

#### Primary Education:

We create presentations, illustrations, and newsletters.

### Workflow:

Our workflow includes receiving project assignments from other teams and meeting with team managers to discuss ideas. We create mockups for projects and present our ideas for feedback and revisions.

If you would like discuss designs or possible projects, feel free to message us in the **\#design** channel on slack at least one week prior to the deadline. Please have an idea and descriptions/references prepared.Projects We Work On
