# Design Team

## Our Workflow

Bit Project Content Creators work with all departments within the organization to design and produce original, high quality content that can be used in for branding and marketing.

### Departments:

#### Marketing

Event/Recruitment Flyers, Presentation Slides for meetings, Document Styling for formal pitches, Merchandise designs, Logos

#### Developer Relations

Event/Recruitment Flyers, Workshop Presentation Slides, Conceptual Info-graphics, Logos

#### Primary Education

**Presentation Slides**  
Primary Ed uses presentation slides to host hands-on learning activities for elementary students. Since elementary kids are less likely to read the slides, we focus on illustrating a multitude of graphics to communicate key concepts and engage the young audience. The text on the presentation slides are kept to a minimum and questions directed towards the audience such as "What did you observe?" are highlighted to help kids follow along in the activity.   
  
**Email Newsletter**   
A weekly email newsletter containing is sent out to parents of elementary students. The newsletter contains latest updates about Bit Project, as well as a weekly learning activity parents and kids can do. We designed the Newsletter activity to have two parts: 1. a section for parents that describes learning objectives, 2. a section for kids, which includes activity instructions, fill in the blank questions, and small, easy-to-read paragraphs of core concepts.  
  
Social Media  
We plan on targeting both parents and kids using Facebook and Twitter.   
  
 

### Workflow:

Our workflow includes receiving project assignments from other teams and meeting with team managers to discuss ideas. We create mockups for projects and present our ideas for feedback and revisions.

If you would like discuss designs or possible projects, feel free to message us in the **\#design** channel on slack at least one week prior to the deadline. Please have an idea and descriptions/references prepared.
