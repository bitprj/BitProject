</table>## **Content** Marketing OKRs 

The Content Marketing team serves to create content for our audience and we serve our audience first. Without an audience, content created cannot support our objectives. Every blog post published under Bit Project should be crafted with our audience needs and wants in mind. The bit Project blog is not self-serving; if content is purely promotional and adds no value to our readership, it will not be published.

### Objectives <a id="objectives"></a>

1. Build credibility and authority.
2. Increase awareness of GitLab the company, product, and community.
3. Increase organic search rankings and traffic.
4. Contribute to lead generation and revenue.

### **Success Metrics**

1. Engagement: \# of page views
2. Reach: \# of new visitors
3. Conversion: \# of subscribers both net new and total

## **On-boarding**

## Content Marketing Project Management Guidelines

Content Marketing uses GitHub for agile project management using **issues**. Read through the documentation on each of these GitHub features if you are unfamiliar.

The **Marketing Repository** houses all content projects.published under Bit Project. All issues pertaining to the **Content Team** must be in the Content Marketing Repository. 

Every issue should be in one of four statuses. Status labels should be used on all issues within the Marketing group:

* `blog post`: every blog post idea, proposal, draft, etc. **MUST** have this label
* `priority`: blog posts that should be worked on immediately \(please provide a rationale in your issue description\)
* `Blog-Pitch`: blog post ideas that are waiting for triage
* `Blog-Planning/in progress`: accepted pitches and blog posts that are assigned to a member of the Content Marketing/Editorial team
* `Blog-Review`: blog posts that are ready for an editorial review
* `Blog-Freeze`: blog post is being reviewed by the Editorial team. No additional changes should be made until the label is lifted.
* `Blog::Waiting for author`: blog posts that have been reviewed by the Editorial team and assigned back to the author to address feedback or approve for scheduling
* `Blog::Scheduled`: Blog posts that have completed reviews and are scheduled for publishing
* `Guest/Partner post`: blog posts that are authored and submitted from a contributor outside of Bit Project
* `case study`: blog posts that include a partner/other organization interview

## Publishing Schedule

With the exception of time-sensitive announcements and news, we are aiming to have blog posts scheduled two weeks ahead.

* We will publish 2-3 posts per week, aiming to have a variety of topics covered within the same week.
* We will stagger publishing, generally avoiding posting on Fridays and in the last few days of the month.
* We aim to ensure that posts that are likely to be popular are live in time to be included in the weekly newsletter that goes out every monday.
