  Here are a list of easy starter tasks for new design hires. Each case will be
  different. Deadlines are subject to change and depends on the ongoing project
  timelines.

# Design Team Onboarding

## Project 1: Shadow Workflow 

This is a general outline. Some parts of the project may take longer than others and deadlines depend on team availability and the hard deadline of project. We primarily communicate over **Slack.** [**Please read the MongoDB Graphic Issue** ](https://github.com/bitprj/marketing/issues/27)**to see our workflow in practice.**

### 0. Receive project brief

We will all be assigned a task and take notes on what the Client Wants. Clients will create a GitHub Issue or request us through Slack, and sometimes project is discussed over Zoom.

 ex. Daniel says "I want a group of students working together" , "we need a covid 19 and twitter grpahic" etc.

### 1. Research 

Research background info on anything relevant to the project \(and take short notes if necessary\) 

**What is the graphic about?**   
ex. if Daniel says "Covid19 and Twitter API", look into both topics and learn about what they do/the purpose. Be able to describe what we are trying to communicate with the graphic.  _**"Covid19 and Twitter API"**_ -&gt; "using code to process large amounts of data to analyze trends/ correlations between Covid19 and human behavior"   
_**"Twitter API"**_ -&gt; "APIs act as the middleman between human\(programmer\) and the server\(data\). APIs obtain and deliver information from the sever to the programmer."

**Who is the graphic for?**   
ex. if we are making a graphic for college students, research what those kinds of graphics look like 

**What are some graphics that successfully communicate something similar or relevant to the main concept?**   
ex. how have other designers shown people working together? coding to create a project? using data to visualize concepts? etc.   
**Save these reference imgs. Present your findings to the team \(over slack or team zoom meeting\)**

### 2. Brainstorm/Sketches 

After discussing research, team will brainstorm and generate an overall concept/list of necessary elements in the graphic 

ex. TwitterAPI and Covid graphic needs:   
1. Students collaborating   
2. Coding/ Big Data  
3. Sense of Location/Real World Application

**Create at least 3 sketches of possible graphics. Share sketches and discuss with team over Slack**, proceed to finalize concept/sketch.

Once the sketch is finalized, design team will generate a list of required assets and delegate/assign work. 

ex. TwitterAPI and Covid graphic assets:  
1. People --_Lilly_  
2. Code panels --_Rochelle_  
3. 3D blocks \(with light\) --_Lilly_  
4. Globe --_Lilly and New Hire_  
Other responsibilities will also be delegated as needed-- for example, color schemes 

### 3. First Iteration 

Use **Adobe Illustrator** to illustrate what you were assigned to create. Keep in mind that the team needs to be able to make alterations like changing the shape or color of the object. **Present your first draft, receive feedback over Slack.** 

#### \*\*\*\*[**Please read the MongoDB Graphic Issue** ](https://github.com/bitprj/marketing/issues/27)**to see how we work with feedback/critique to evolve the design.** 

### 4. Second Iteration

Incorporate feedback and continue working in Illustrator. Present work and receive feedback ****over Slack.

### 5. Finalize Design

Clean up the Illustrator file if necessary \(delete any unused layers or objects\), group elements together for easier future use, rename layers accordingly. Export graphics as **svg** and **png**.

## Project 2: Create Graphic Variants 

Using existing Illustrator files, create different versions of past graphics by moving objects and changing the color scheme.

**1. Make a copy of the art board** containing the original graphic. Do not make any changes to the original. 

**2. Create different versions by moving objects.** Tip: group objects for faster workflow. If new assets are needed, consult design team. Edit objects if needed. 

**3. Change the color scheme.** when finished, make sure to update the color squares \(off to the side of the graphic\) with the colors you used. 

**4. Share your progress**/work with design team, receive and incorporate feedback. 

**5. Finalize**, clean up layers and objects, export as svg and png.

## Project 3: Primary Ed Newsletter Graphics 

Primary Ed needs graphics for their weekly newsletter activities. The graphics will be used in presentations, pdfs, and on fb. 

**0. Receive project brief.** make note of what the Client **Wants**, **Who** the target audience is, and **Where** it will be used. 

**1. Read project text and review reference imgs**, ask any questions about content if necessary. 

**2. Start illustrating** the graphics based on the reference imgs provided. 

**3. Share progress** with design team and primary ed coordinators. incorporate feedback if necessary. 

**4. Export as png** and share the illustrator file with design team. Tip: Use the "**Export as Single Asset**" feature in Illustrator to quickly export pngs. Creating separate art boards for graphics is good practice, but when exporting please make sure that the graphic is as cropped in as possible. Exporting as Single Asset automatically ensures this and saves you time.

## Project 4: Avatar Library \(ongoing\)

Generate a library of usable people avatars. These can be standing, sitting, headshots, etc. Assets need to be versatile, consistent, reusable, and easy to modify/recolor. Send progress updates to design team over Slack.
