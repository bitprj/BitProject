## Social Channels and Audience Segmentation 

### Twitter 

**Content/Execution**

* Broad audience - all our content gets shared here, but tone should still appeal to devs.
* 1 or more tweets per day, plus retweets
  * Schedule between 12 am - 5 pm PT \(A large part of our audience is in EMEA, and we find an increase in organic impressions and engagement when we schedule tweets for their morning and workday\)
  * At least 30 mins apart
* Aim for variety & roughly even mix of main topics: Education, Open Source, Various DevRel Topic,  community articles & appreciation
* Check mentions at least once per day, pull out articles to share with the team and favorite positive mentions.
* Keep a list of our most engaged followers; keep these in mind for opportunities outside of socialâ€“blogging, live streamed interview etc.

**Goals**

* 15 tweets per day
* 2-4 videos published natively per month
* 5 lead-generating content items from the backlog published per month
* Consider [takeovers.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/12/work-experience-boy-takes-southern-rails-twitter-account-things/) Would need to develop an instructions kit & think about how/who to pilot.

### Facebook

**Content/Execution**

* Community and thought-leadership focused
* 3-4 facebook posts per week
* At least 2 hours apart
* Live events are more company/culture focused
  * talks by or AMAs with People Ops, etc.

**Goals**

* Consider streaming a webcast on Facebook Live \(a simple toggle switch in Zoom allows this\) and compare the performance to YouTube live streaming
* When the speaker cameras are enabled in Zoom webinars, natively publish clips of webcasts for post-promotion.

### LinkedIn 

Sometimes, posts that Bit Project team-members propose for our blog may be a better fit for native publishing on LinkedIn. This is not a negative, it's usually due to the content team's strategic priorities at the time. The Social Marketing Manager will recommend that you publish on your own LinkedIn, and if you agree, the Social Marketing Manager will help you finalize the post and socialize it internally for best results.

**Content/Execution**

* 2 posts per month
  * Non-tutorial original blog posts
* Posts around particular features,, company culture, people team new practices, problem/solution or personal growth structured posts; include links back to homepage

**Goals**

* Identify key LinkedIn groups to join/share content in
* Native posts on LinkedIn
  * Encourage targeted employees to do so; think of incentive/framing as professional development that we will help edit.
* Curate and share articles from other publishers on remote work/culture that we want to elevate

### Medium 

Bit Project has a [Medium publication](https://medium.com/gitlab-magazine), and all Bit Project contributors may be added as writers! To be added as a writer to the publication, [import](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post) a blog post that you authored to your personal Medium account, and submit it to the Bit Project publication \(by hitting `edit` -&gt; `submit to publication` -&gt; `Bit Project`\). the Social Marketing Manager will approve you as a writer and help finalize the post before publishing.

If you submit original content \(i.e., not originally published somewhere else\) to the publication for review, he/she may edit and publish your post. We want to highlight writers wherever possible, so we highly encourage you to import posts to your personal Medium.

**Content/Execution**

* Brand and thought leadership-focused
* Favorite articles about Bit Project
* Aim to post one article to Medium every two weeks
* Cross-post our original thought-leadership posts to Medium, linking back to blog
  * Use the [import tool](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post); do not copy and paste.
