# Joining the Team

## Submitting an Application

To first let us know that you are interested in joining the team, apply here: [https://www.bitproject.org/join](https://www.bitproject.org/join). Make sure to select that you would like to join the core team for "work goal" and check marketing when asked for your team\(s\) of interest.

## Day 1

### 1. Attending the Introduction to Bit Project Webinar

Daniel, the president of Bit Project, will give an introduction to Bit Project in general. No matter what team you are applying to, attendance to this webinar is required as it is a beginning stepping stone into what exactly Bit Project does.

This will take place over zoom. You are not required to make an account, but you must download zoom which is looked below.

### 2. Joining our Slack

Slack is our form of team communication. Files, code, information, and much more can be shared easily to members of the team through instant messaging. Multiple channels are created to communicate while having easy access to private messaging to anyone on the team. All important information and conversations will most likely take place on slack

Before making an account, you must download slack onto both your computer and mobile device. Make a slack account and join our workspace through the link below:

If you already have slack, here is our workspace: bitdarlene.slack.com

Once you are on slack, please complete the following tasks:

* Have your school name and team in the description of your profile
* Add a profile picture 
* DM Minh-Tu Nguyen to set up a 1:1 Meeting
* Send an introduction of yourself to the \#newmembers channel
  * Ex: "Hi! My name is Daniel from UC Davis's Bit Project." 

## Day 2

### 3. 1:1 Meeting with Director of Marketing

During your meeting with the director of marketing, the director will go over what exactly the marketing team is, the purpose of the team, and what the team does. The director will then assign you your tasks, consisting of watching a set of webinars and utilizing our marketing tools.

### 4. Watching Our Webinars

There are three webinars that you must watch: Communication, Culture, and GitHub. Each of these will teach you more about Bit Project and our expectations of each member. You must also be familiar with how to use GitHub.

## Day 3

### 5. HubSpot Task

You must create an account and once you do, we will grant you access to the Bit Project HubSpot. Learn how to use this platform through the HubSpot guide which can be found here: [Airtable & HubSpot](growth-marketing/airtable-and-hubspot.md).

Your task is the following:

* [ ] Import the given Emails
* [ ] Email Blast the 10 Emails
* [ ] Delete the Given Email Addresses

This must be completed within 3 days of granted access.

## Day 5

### 6. Completing 1:1 With Director of Marketing

Message Minh-Tu again to schedule another but shorter meeting. During this meet-up, you will be given feedback and practice taking notes on GitHub during the meeting. You will also give us feedback on your experience with the onboarding process and how you felt throughout the whole situation.

You will then be integrated into the team! You will be introduced to the weekly duties and specified tasks that vary every week. These duties and tasks will require you to become familiar \(and eventually proficient\) in the marketing tools that we use, including but not limited to Hubspot and Airtable.
