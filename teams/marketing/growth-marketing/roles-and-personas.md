# Roles & Personas

### Roles vs personas <a id="roles-vs-personas"></a>

Personas describe the ideal target for Bit Project. They help us define our messaging and marketing delivery. They are theoretical people to target. By defining their concerns and where they go for information, we can best spend our marketing efforts by focusing on this ideal target.

Roles are distinct job titles. These are the real people you will encounter while selling. You will find a contact at an organization with a specific role. Understanding the challenges faced by each student, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person.

### Personas <a id="personas"></a>

Personas are a generalized way of talking about the ideal target we are aiming to communicate with and design for. They help us not only define our messaging and marketing delivery, but also our product. Keeping personas in mind allows us to use the correct language and make the best decisions to address their specific problems and pain points.
