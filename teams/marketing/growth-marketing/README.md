# Growth Marketing

As a Growth Marketing Partner \(GMP\), you focus on outreach, prospecting, and lead qualification. To do so, you need to have an understanding of not only product and industry knowledge, but also sales soft skills, and internal tools and processes. This handbook page will act as a guide to those topics as well as general information about the GMP team.

</table>## **On-boarding**

In your first month at Bit Project we want to help ensure you have everything you need to be successful in your position! You will go through enablement videos, live sessions and activities covering a wide range of getting started topics.

## Growth Marketing OKRs 

Each GMP will have a monthly quota that is based solely on **Accepted Opportunities \(AOs\)**. Each GMP will have reduced quotas during the ramping up \(1-2 months\) period following initial onboarding. 

* Results
  * Pipeline value of GMP sourced opportunities
  * Number of New Applicants and Successful recruits
  * Diversity and Inclusion Metrics from People Team
* Activity
  * % of named accounts contacted
  * Number of opportunities created
  * Number of calls made
  * Number of personalized emails sent
  * Daily outbound metrics
    * At least 30 emails/week
    * At least 15 dials/month

While the below measurements do not impact your quota attainment, they are monitored by Marketing leadership.

## Personas

Personas describe the ideal target for Bit Project. They help us define our messaging and marketing delivery. They are theoretical people to target. By defining their concerns and where they go for information, we can best spend our marketing efforts by focusing on this ideal target.

Roles are distinct job titles. These are the real people you will encounter while selling. You will find a contact at an organization with a specific role. Understanding the challenges faced by each student, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person.

## GMP Workflow & Process

As an GMP, you will be focused on leads - both inbound and outbound. At the highest level, a lead is a person who shows interest in Bit Project through inbound lead generation tactics or through outbound prospecting.

### **Inbound Leads**

**Inbound lead** generation is creation of content and campaigns that bring in website visitors and converts them into **leads**. You can think of **inbound** as laying out a trail of information and incentives that prospects can follow in towards your brand and, hopefully, all the way to the bottom of your funnel**.**

**Inbound Lead Generation**

Inbound lead generation often uses digital channels - social media, email, mobile/web apps, search engines, websites, etc - as well as in-person marketing activities to meet potential buyers where they are. When people interact with Bit Project, they are logged and assigned to GMPs on our CRM, HubSpot. 

**Working Inbound Leads**

GMPs are responsible for following up with leads by reviewing their information, reaching out, and working with them to understand their goals, needs, and problems. Once you have that information, you can use our **qualification criteria \[ADD DOCUMENTATION\]** to determine if this is someone who has strong potential to join Bit Project and therefore should be connected with the **people team** for next steps. As you are the connection between Marketing and the rest of the organization you want to make sure every lead you pass to the People team is as qualified as possible.

These MQLs will show up in your dashboard on HubSpot. The views, listed below **\[insert screenshot here\]** , allow you to see your leads in a categorized way to simplify your workflow. You will be responsible for following up with all of the leads assigned. 

### **Outbound** Prospecting

Outbound lead generation is done through prospecting to people who fall into our target audience and could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new partnerships through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the marketing pipeline until they eventually convert into contributors.

You will work closely with other GMPs and your GMM to build a strategy for certain companies, location or personas you as an aligned team want to target. It is crucial that you are very intentional and strategic in your approach and always keep the customer experience in mind. When reaching out, offer value and become a trusted advisor to ensure we always leave a positive impression whether there is current demand or not.
