### Objective

Bit Project provides students around the world a platform on which to contribute to technical education and make it accessible to all. 

The Marketing Team at Bit Project has two main goals: **Growth** and **Presence.** Our team works with various software to manage and develop strong relationships with industry partners and student contributors around the world.

We plan on transforming our marketing plan from a more traditional process to Growth Marketing, so that we can focus on building long-term connections with students, educators, and industry partners from around the world to develop high standard dynamic education.

### **Marketing Philosophy**

* **Transparency**

  We want to be transparent in all of our marketing efforts to build trust and engage with more students.

* **Data-Driven Marketing** At Bit Project, we are committed to making data informed decisions. To that end, we publish our monthly metrics reports in the Documentation

### **Growth Marketing** 

As a Growth Marketing Partner\(GMP\), you focus on outreach, prospecting, and lead qualification. To do so, you need to have an understanding of not only product and industry knowledge, but also sales soft skills, and internal tools and processes. The handbook page will act as a guide to those topics as well as general information about the growth marketing team.

### **Content Marketing** 

The Content Marketing team is responsible for content strategy, development, and operations, including the stewardship of Bit Project's audiences, users, contributors, and partners' content needs. The Content Team creates engaging, inspiring, and relevant content, executing integrated content programs to deliver useful and cohesive content experiences that build trust and brand awareness for Bit Project.



### _**MarketingOps**_ **\(Fall 2020\)** 

Support the marketing team by managing and developing technical workflows around the CRM system.

### _**Field Marketing**_ \(Fall 2020\) 

The role of field marketing is to support marketing messages at a regional level through in-person interactions \(quality vs. quantity\) coupled with multi-touch activities. Field Marketing programs are focused on relationship building with prospective Bit Project contributors to support and expand opportunities as well as pulling pipeline through the funnel more quickly.

## Marketing Project Management Guidelines

Marketing uses GitHub for agile project management using **issues**. Read through the documentation on each of these GitHub features if you are unfamiliar.

The **Marketing Repository** houses all marketing projects.

* Each **Issue** represents a discrete unit of work with a deliverable. For example  **\[INSERT EXAMPLE HERE\]**
* Every **Pull Request** should have an issue so that it can be tracked on issue boards. 
* **Milestones** represent units of work to be completed within a specific time frame, sometimes referred to as sprints. They are comprised of multiple issues that share a common due date, and help break large projects into more manageable parts.
* **Projects** represent integrated marketing campaigns that comprise of multiple issues. Each **MPM** should create a project under the Marketing repository at the start of each campaign. 

Every issue should be in one of four statuses. Status labels should be used on all issues within the Marketing group:

* `plan` - work that is proposed, in an exploratory state.
  * To exit the plan stage the work must be assigned to a DRI.
  * DRI accepts responsibility for the task by changing the label from `plan` to `wip` and creating an pull request \(PR\), if appropriate. The plan status is optional, as issues that don't require formal planning can be opened and labeled `wip`.
* `wip` - work in progress that has been accepted and assigned to a DRI.
  * Work in this stage should not be merged.
  * Pull requests \(PRs\) should be prepended with `WIP:`. At Bit Project we allow reviewers to start reviewing right away before work is complete.
  * Use MVC \(Minimum Viable Commit\): At any time, if the work is complete enough that merging would be better than what current exist the issue should be labeled with `review` and `WIP` should be removed from the title.
* **Optional**\*: `review` - work has been completed enough that it is ready for formal review and approval.
  * Work that is approved can be either merged or scheduled.
  * The review status is optional.
  * Work that doesn't require review can simply be merged/closed.
* **Optional**: `scheduled` - work that is complete but should be scheduled for a future date.
  * Scheduled status is optional as not all work will need to be scheduled.
* `closed` - when work is delivered the issue should be closed.

## **Integrated Marketing Campaigns**

* Integrated Campaign - Organized by marketing programs team, collaborating across marketing teams toward a launch date. It incorporates multiple offers and multiple channels \(see integrated campaigns section below\).
* Digital Marketing Campaign - Online marketing efforts organized by the digital marketing programs team to drive engagement, conversions, traffic, or revenue
* Brand Awareness Campaign - Higher-level print and digital marketing efforts organized by the corporate marketing team. These are focused on brand recognition.

Teams within the Marketing department collaborate to produce Integrated Campaigns. An Integrated Campaign is a communication effort that includes several campaign tactics such as blog posts, emails, events, advertisements, content on [bitproject.org,](https://bitproject.org) videos, case studies, white papers, surveys, social outreach, and webcasts. An Integrated Campaign will have a campaign theme that summarizes the message we are communicating to our market.
