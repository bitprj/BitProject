### 1. Meeting the Director

Kevin, the director of developer relations, will provide an introduction to the team. During this meeting, you will be asked questions about your previous experience and assessed for commitment. He will provide you with your next tasks and invite you to slack. 

#### Joining our Slack, Zoom, and Airtable

#### Slack

Slack is our form of team communication. Files, code, information, and much more can be shared easily to members of the team through instant messaging. Multiple channels are created to communicate while having easy access to private messaging to anyone on the team. All important information and conversations will most likely take place on slack

Before making an account, you must download slack onto both your computer and mobile device. Make a slack account and join our workspace through the link below:

Link: [https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX](https://app.slack.com/client/TJ2FB5CE9/CJ4BRKELX)

If you already have slack, here is our workspace: bitdarlene.slack.com

Once you are on slack, please complete the following tasks:

* Have your school name and team in the description of your profile
* Add a profile picture 
* Send an introduction of yourself to the \#welcome channel
  * Ex: "Hi! My name is Daniel from UC Davis's Bit Project." 

#### Zoom

By this point, you need to have easy access to Zoom and we highly recommend that you download the Zoom app for future 1:1s and team meetings. 

#### Airtable, Google Calendar

Your manager will have to be the one to give you access to any relevant Airtables and the Bit Project Meetings Google Calendar based on your role/team.
