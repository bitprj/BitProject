Please follow all steps. During the interview, your interviewer will ask you questions based off of the position you applied for and your previous experience. You will be invited to join our slack and informed if your next tasks during your interview. Once again, I am here to help you throughout your whole onboarding process so do not hesitate to ask any questions! Contact me at \[_onborading email_\] or on slack.
