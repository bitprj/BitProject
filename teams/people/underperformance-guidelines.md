# Underperformance Guidelines

## What does "underperforming" mean?

At Bit Project, we care a lot about meeting objectives and key results \(OKRs\). The president will set OKRs for directors, directors for managers, and managers for their team members. These OKRs will depend on the team and the position that you are in. If you are not meeting these OKRs, then you are underperforming.

 Not meeting OKRs = Underperforming
