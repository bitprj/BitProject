# Underperformance Guidelines

## What does "underperforming" mean?

At Bit Project, we care a lot about meeting objectives and key results \(OKRs\). The president will set OKRs for directors, directors for managers, and managers for their team members. These OKRs will depend on the team and the position that you are in. If you are not meeting these OKRs, then you are underperforming.

 Not meeting OKRs = Underperforming
{% endhint %}

## Steps in the underperformance process

1. When your lead notices that the individual is underperforming, they will first have a talk with them.
2. Your lead reports to the Learning and Development Manager regarding the areas in which the individual needs improvement on.
3. L&D Manager creates a personalized training plan for the individual and assigns tasks through a github issue. Tasks can range from watching webinars, doing assessments, and completing small projects. The individual must complete tasks by the deadline as shown on their issue.
4. L&D manager has frequent 1:1s to track progress.
5. L&D manager assesses the individual's performance through assessments, ability to complete tasks on time, quality of completed tasks, etc.
6. If the individual has met expectations, they will go back to their original role!
