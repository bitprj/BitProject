# How to Format Curriculum into Slides

## **Make sure to copy and make a new document of “Copy of the Template”** [**https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1viM9vGdztmKKUPFWqaffzFPkd\_Kt\_H\_5BMzRmAr6dy8/edit\#slide=id.g742daec349\_0\_58**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1viM9vGdztmKKUPFWqaffzFPkd_Kt_H_5BMzRmAr6dy8/edit#slide=id.g742daec349_0_58)

## **Intro slide**

* Title: centereds to include grades and subject
  * Subjects: physics, biology, chemistry, geology, etc.
  * For example, it should be in this format: “Biology Grades K-1”
* This should be in the font “Nunito + font “Nunito” + font size 52 + in the color black
* Neeo” in the size 28
  * The subject should be in the color white and the grades should be in Bit blue 
* Include icons/vectors from [thenounproject.com](https://thenounproject.com/) that would match with the activity
  * For example, if the main concept of the activity was about the Earth then find an image of the Earth to include with the title 
* Include pictures from google if you do not want to use icons from Noun Project
  * Make sure it’s pretty! 

## **NGSS Standards**

* **Next Generation Science Standards \(NGSS\) are research-based, current K–12 science content standards that set the expectations for what students should know.** 
* **were also adopted to assist teachers in the implementation of the new science standards and to aid in the development of the new science curriculum framework.**
* **Use them because they’re a standardized and clear way of communicating what concepts we have incorporated into our lessons.**
* [**https://www.nextgenscience.org/search-standards**](https://www.nextgenscience.org/search-standards) **→ Standards by DCI on the right hand column**
* **NGSS on slide should be title, nunito font, 30 pt Bit blue**
* **Title of standard bolded and above standard description \(work sans, 18, black\)**
* **Second to the last slide**

## **Concepts**

* **Include concepts relevant to the science of your activity, with an increasing amount in higher grade levels. Start with 2-3 for K-1 levels and include a couple more for the next grade levels**
* **Can be in the form of key vocabulary that helps develop an understanding of the most basic level of science**
* **Define the term in a simple way related to what you are doing, use it repeated times, and check for understanding possibly through questions**
* **Make sure of reference resources you used by putting links on the learn more page \(30 pt, Bit blue, Nunito\)**
* **2nd slide**

## **Steps/Procedure**

* **Title of the slide: Does not need to be centered + font Nunito + font size 30 + in the color bit blue**
* **The written procedure: font Works Sans + font size 18 + in the color black**
* **Find the steps/procedure from the Steps/Procedure Google Doc of the activity you are working on \(the procedure of the activity you are making slides for should be in a separate Google Document from the revised draft\)** 
* **Distribute the steps throughout 3-5 slides with discussion questions after each step or concept** 
  * **For example, in the activity “What’s in a Fruit”**
    * **The first step is to cut the fruit in half which then follows with the questions: “what do you notice about the inside of the fruit” “how is it the same or different with other fruits?”**
* **Include an image from The Noun Project that relates to the steps/procedure**

## **Discussion Questions**

* **Discussion questions must be relevant to NGSS and the concept introduced in the activity**
* **Try not to ask questions that can be easily answered with “yes” or “no”. If you must ask these questions, ask follow up questions that require the student to explain**
* **Discussion questions must not be too easy or too hard**
  * **Must be tailored to the grade level you are working with** 
* **Types of questions to consider**
  * **Prediction questions**
    * **Ex. What do you think will happen if you do …?**
  * **Analytical questions**
    * **Ex. What does each part of your model represent?**
  * **Compare and contrast with explanation** 
    * **Ex. What is different about your model versus the model other people in your group made? Which one do you think will work better?**
  * **Creative questions**
    * **Ex. You have all these material to use to build the strongest house. Draw out your plan and be creative about what material you can use to build your house.** 
  * **Troubleshooting and problem solving questions**
    * **Ex. During the testing phase, what about your house that worked? What made your house fall? What can you do to make it stronger?**
* **These discussion questions are to be added on the same slides as the steps/procedure.** 

## **Materials List**

* **Title the slide “Materials List \(per student\)” or “Materials List \(per group\)” with the font Nunito \(font size 30\) in the color Bit blue**
* **The actual list needs to be in the font Works Sans \(font size 18\) in the color black**
* **The amount of materials needed for each student or per group**
* **For example, if an activity requires each student to have one stick then in the materials list you would type “1 stick”.** 
* **An example of a materials list \(per student\)**
  * **1 stick**
  * **1 glue**
  * **1 paper** 
* **3rd slide**

## **Resources**

* **Title the slide “Learn More:” in the font Nunito \(size 30\) in the color Bit blue** 
* **The links will be in the font Arial \(size 18\) in the color Bit blue**
* **Needs to include the link/source of where you found the activity** 
  * **For example, BetterLesson and The Scientific American** 
* **Include links of where teachers can learn more information about certain concepts or vocabulary words**
  * **For example, teachers may want to learn more about electric circuits. You can google websites that explains this concept and link it onto the slide**
* **All links need to be in hyperlink format** 
  * **1. Copy and paste link onto the resources slide**
  * **2. Right click and click on “link”**
  * **3. Edit the link in the “text” section and shorten it to slideshowto.com**
* **Last slide**

## **Approval 1**

## **Peer Review 1**

* **After you are done with your slides rough draft, let the team know that you are ready for your first peer review.**
* **When you are peer reviewing other people’s work:**
  * **Give STRICT constructive criticism! This is one of the only times we find errors!!**
  * **Imagine yourself as a student in that grade level, will you be able to understand the language and concepts taught in the slides?**
  * **If you can think of ANY way to improve other people’s work, mention it!**
  * **Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, diction, clarity…** 
* **Don’t forget to edit after your draft has been peer reviewed!**
  * **NOTE: If your peer review comments something only in one of the three versions, but you know that comment or edit can be applied to all three versions, don’t forget to change it in all three versions.**

## **Peer Review 2**

* **This is the last chance for peer review. After you are done editing your draft from the first peer review, let the team know that you are ready for your second peer review.** 
* **When you are peer reviewing other people’s work:**
  * **Give STRICT constructive criticism! This is the LAST TIME we find errors!!**
  * **Imagine yourself as a student in that grade level, will you be able to understand the language and concepts taught in the slides?**
  * **If you can think of ANY way to improve other people’s work, mention it!**
  * **Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, diction, clarity…** 
* **Don’t forget to edit after your draft has been peer reviewed!**
  * **NOTE: If your peer review comments something only in one of the three versions, but you know that comment or edit can be applied to all three versions, don’t forget to change it in all three versions.**

## **Blurb**

* **A quick summary of what the activity is about**
* **Include what students are doing in the activity**
* **Concepts or principles of what they are learning should be included as well**
* **Remember target audience is adults\(parents, teachers, volunteers\) rather than students**
* **Approximate length of 4-5 sentences\(small paragraph\)**

## **Publish**

* **Make sure slides can be viewed by anyone on the team and are not private in your drive**
* **Place them in the appropriate folder with the correct viewing settings** 
* **Select all 3 slides in the folder and update viewing permission to “anyone with the link can view”**
* **To change viewing permission, click the share button in the upper right corner of the docs. There should be a drop down menu to change the viewing permission.** 
* **Add links for each grade level onto the airtable link, so teachers can view and download them**
* **Update the blurb on the website using the link**
