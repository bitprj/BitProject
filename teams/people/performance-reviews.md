# Performance Reviews

## Purpose

Performance reviews are a crucial part of keeping everyone at Bit Project in check. The president will conduct performance reviews with directors, directors with managers, and managers with their team members. Performance reviews are not only a chance to determine what you have been doing right or wrong, but it is also a way to give honest feedback to one another. These will be conducted once a month during the last week of every month. 

## Performance Review Meeting

In Github, under [people](https://github.com/bitprj/people)/[Performance Evaluations](https://github.com/bitprj/people/tree/master/Performance%20Evaluations)/**performanceReview\_template.md**, you will find a template for your performance review meeting. Follow this template to guide your discussion. 

1. Write down the reviewer and reviewee's names and your roles at Bit Project.
2. Prior to the meeting, the reviewer should list OKRs that were set for the reviewee. Then, go through each of them and discuss. For any OKRs that were not met, have a discussion about why that was the case. If the missed OKR was significant, consider having the reviewee go through underperformance training led by the Learning and Development team.
