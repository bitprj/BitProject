# Community Relations

## Our Mission

At Bit Project, our mission it to change all education so everyone can contribute to teach other's learning.

The mission of the Community Relations team is to support the various ways members of the Bit Family  participate in the our community today. 

* Contribute to the curriculum
* Start a Chapter of Bit Project
* Integrate Bit Project into Existing Organizations
  * High School Student Organizations
  * Undergraduate Student Organizations
  * Hobbyist Meetup

We are building an evangelist program to support people who share our mission and want to give tech talks, run local meetups, or help us on our mission on making technical education more accessible.
