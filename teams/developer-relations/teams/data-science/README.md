# Data Science

#### Introduction

With the advent of the "Internet of Things" \(i.e every thing from your watch to your fridge harvesting data and being connected to some sort of computer network\) and the internet as whole, organizations have the ability to accumulate tons and tons of data. However, like a diamond in the rough : work is needed in order to make sense out of this data. Here data science comes into play. Using mathematical and computational techniques data scientists can make useful connections and observations that can help benefit companies and research organizations.

#### Mission

 Here at Bit, we want you take get exposed to the tricks and tools that are actually used in industry-level data science. Moreover, we want to help you learn data science concepts that will help you in both research and industry.
