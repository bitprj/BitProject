# Guide to Being a Reviewer

Reviewers are in charge of **curriculum departments.** Each department is a team of 4-6 people who work on different modules of curriculum. They will be tasked with a project, usually covering a topic, and a deadline. By this deadline, all activities, labs and workshops for that project should be completed.

## Starting Off: Receiving Module Assignments

All reviewers will be assigned an issue in the **bitproject** repository, to be completed within _3 days of assignment._

### Pre-approval Checklist
