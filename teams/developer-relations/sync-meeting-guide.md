1. [ ] Address the fact that this meeting will be recorded. Let people who are uncomfortable about this leave.
2. [ ] Any pressing announcements or changes are addressed by the reviewer.
3. [ ] The reviewer announces their weekly goals/progress and asks for feedback from the developers.
4. [ ] The reviewer reviews last week's progress and provides feedback for the developers.
5. [ ] The developers do a "Round-Robin" style review \(for each other's work from the previous week\) and come up with issue ideas. These ideas are relayed to the reviewer.
   * A Round Robin review is as follows:  `Developer 1 reviews Developer 2`, `Developer 2 reviews Developer 3`, and `Developer 3 reviews Developer 1`
   *  Note down or remember the rotation\(in the meeting agenda\) for the week so the reviewer can try can assign a different order next week\(by looking at the previous week's order\).
