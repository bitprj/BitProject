# Joining as an Organization

## Why Workshops? 

Bit Project has created a number of workshops where students are able to learn about the newest technologies and developer tools on the market. All materials are created by undergraduate students that are passionate about both education and computer science. These workshops are developed with great attention to detail, incorporating interactive components to develop a stronger understanding of the material. 

Our current available workshop materials focus on a great range of topics, such as Twitter APIs, Leetcode, React, and more. With our company partnerships, official developers have made remarks and given us feedback on certain workshops. For example, we worked with Twitter and some of their developers to create a clear cut Twitter API workshop, ensuring that even non computer science major students are also able to easily grasp the concept. To access our workshop materials, click on the following link: [https://github.com/bitprj/workshops](https://github.com/bitprj/workshops). 

Here at UC Davis, Bit Project has hosted several workshops with great success. For one of our more successful workshops, we partnered with Postman to host an API workshop in which students were able to learn the basics of APIs and the usage of the Postman software. Our own developers created a game: BitBloxes. This game was used to test the student's knowledge of APIs and Postman by having them use the Postman client to call HTTP requests to change colors of boxes on a board. Each type of HTTP request \(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\) performed a different function on the board that would help their team claim the most territory and win. Over 85 students attended this event held at UC Davis, with 71% of attendees being Computer Science students.

Creating these technical workshops provides students with exposure to programs that are frequently used in technical fields of work. As these tools are not taught in schools, it is import to increase the awareness of such developer tools. Therefore, to join Bit Project, we would love it if you and your team would create your own workshop on a topic of your choice! Our team will help you with this development process, providing advice and feedback whenever we could.

## Workshop Checklist Breakdown 

**\*After every stage, you must checkin with your assigned Dev and place your work in your designated GitBook Page.\***

### Placing your work in GitBook. 

During the first meeting of receiving this assignment, you will be invited to the BitProject GitBook. Please sign up for GitBooks at gitbook.com. To find your designated page, go to Developer Relations under Teams. In the drop down, select Joining as an Organization and then your designated page. 

Place your work in its marked locations. After every edit, you are making a new draft. You must click "save" at the bottom left corner. Then click "merge" to have your edits displayed on the official page. 

### Stage 1: Workshop Proposal

In this proposal, you must select a topic of focus for your workshop. It is best to avoid workshops that have already been created by Bit Project to increase diversity with our content. 

Here is an updated list of the workshops we currently have: 

* Intro to React
* Leetcode
* Twitter APIs
* Sketch Together
* Dodge
* GitHub
* MongoDB
* Postman
* Pusher

You can find all of those workshops here: [https://github.com/bitprj/workshops](https://github.com/bitprj/workshops). 

With the topic comes the key components. These are the main ideas that fall within your topic that you want to present. We highly recommend that you start with the very basics then move onto more in depth concepts to make it straightforward for students of all skill levels. 

Each stage should have a due date to work towards. The date for each stage is tentative and can be subject to change; however, the completion date should remain consistent. This time pressure is able to guarantee a higher chance of completion. We recommend that this whole process should take no more than three weeks for a team of four. 

Review with assigned Dev. 

### Stage 2: Interactive Component Idea

Each workshop requires an interactive component that tests the student's knowledge and skill on the topic at hand at the end of the presentation. This should NOT be a Kahoot or any sort of simple trivia game. To actually test whether or not they understood the content, have them apply the knowledge they should have gained. 

You would want to generate ideas of what your interactive component will consist of. After deciding what your component would entail, your team would then plan out how you would create and execute the component. 

Review with assigned Dev.

### Stage 3: Responsibilities Delegated

By this point, your team should have a solid understanding of what needs to be done. Clearly delegate the responsibilities, establishing who is in charge of what. Play by strengths. If someone is better at explanations, have them work more on the presentation portion of the workshop. If someone is more knowledgable in the topic and knows how to code/create the interactive component, leave them in charge of that. Work together on certain sections to optimize quality and quantity. Plan your time accordingly to finish by each stage due date. Have a drawn out timeline of when parts of the workshop should be completed.  

Review with assigned Dev. 

### Stage 4: Presentation Slide Outlines

It is good to work on the outline as a team as you will most likely be presenting the workshop as a team. An appropriate outline should consist of all the slides having titles that clearly state what will be discussed. Establish the workflow: the introduction of the topic then move into more in depth topics. Incorporate your interactive component towards the end. 

Review with assigned Dev. 

### Stage 5: Completing Slides and Interactive Component

The skeleton of the whole workshop is set up and it now needs to be filled in. Fulfill your designated responsibilities and complete the whole workshop. Both presentation slides and the interactive component should be completely flushed out and completed. Your team members should be reviewing and editing the slides at all times, catching any grammar mistakes, fixing syntax, improving styling, etc. Not only that, go over the interactive component multiple times to ensure that it is working the way your team intended it to. 

Your interactive component must be inputed into GitHub. There should be a well documented README and instructions for replicating the interactive component into individual systems. Anyone \(including beginners\) should be able to follow the directions to replicate the interactive component. 

During this time, you should already have a general idea of where the presentation itself will go. Write the presentation script that you will later utilize to practice presenting the workshop.

Review with assigned Dev.  

### Stage 6: Presentation Practice

You are expected to practice this workshop multiple times as with practice comes confidence and consistency. Then schedule a time to practice presenting in front of your assigned Dev. This Dev will give you feedback and advice on how to improve your presentation skills as well as provide any last minute remarks on your presentation slides and interactive component. Once given all the feedback, practice giving the presentation with the changes. 

### Stage 7: Present to Bit & Organization

You must schedule a date to present your workshop to Bit Project and your organization through zoom. Once you do that, keep practicing until the time has come. Present your work to your audience, and you have successfully created a workshop! 

## Postman Workshop Example

### Stage 1: Workshop Proposal

Our team of devs worked with the company Postman to create a workshop that focuses on the basics of APIs and how the Postman software utilizes APIs.
