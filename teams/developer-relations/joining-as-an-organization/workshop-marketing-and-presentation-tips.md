# Workshop: Marketing and Presentation Tips

## Time & Place:

### In Person

An ideal location would be a place accessible to all students, such as a classroom or meeting room on-campus. Make sure that your location contains all required materials to present, such as a projector and adaptor for your computer or a sound system to clearly project your voice. Take into account the estimated number of attendees and any specific necessities for the workshop.

Pick a time when most people do not have classes; this will usually be at night. The workshop should be the only event on your chosen day. When reserving the room, book extra time before and after the actual workshop for preparation and clean-up.

Communicate with the campus staff in charge of facility reservation to make sure you understand the booking process. Try and book the same room at the same time when having events. Consistency makes it easier for students to remember.

### Zoom

Time and place are still essentials despite the workshop taking place online. We highly recommend Zoom as it is easy to have audience members join. An ideal location for the presenter\(s\) is a quiet location that has minimal disruptions and excess noise. Make sure you are able to project your voice into your microphone so that everyone is able to hear you.

You should still pick a time when most people do not have classes. Towards the late afternoon and night are probably your best times. Avoid having your workshop overlap with other events that are taking place that day.

Communicate with your potential audience members by having them download zoom and sending them a zoom link in advance to the date. Also ensure that your whole team is able to and knows how to use zoom \(such as how to share their screen, talk in the chat, etc.\).

Set up a system for the students to be able to stop you and ask questions. They could send their questions into the chat, and your team would periodically stop to go over the questions. Or they could send a reaction and your team would need to be on the look out for any of the reactions. There are many other ways to have this process run smoothly. Select the one your team prefers the most and inform the students of it at the beginning of the workshop.

## Marketing: Classes, Tabling and Flyers, CS Department, Professors:

Marketing is an essential part to having a successful event turnout rate. The following are suggestions on how you can market.

### Classroom announcements

With the permission of professors, make an announcement to your fellow peers. Target classes that relate to the subject of your presentation. For example, if you are hosting a computer science workshop such as Introduction to Python, make the announcement in computer science classes. The announcement should be short but memorable. Include a short introduction of the organization you represent and the event you are advertising for. Clearly state the date, time, and location. If you can, write a brief advertisement on the board, projector screen, or wherever it is obviously visible. Emphasize any incentive to attend the event \(i.e., free food\). If you have flyers, have helpers pass them out to students as the speaker talks and place them at the front of the room for students to take after class.

### Tabling and Flyers

With the school’s permission, pass flyers out in highly populated areas. It also helps to have large, eye-catching visuals such as posters that advertise your organization or event so those passing by can gain a quick insight to the advertisement. Engage with as many students as possible, but if they appear disinterested or rushed, do not initiate any conversation.

Offer a flyer and if the student is disinterested, mention the event’s location, date and time, and any incentives \(e.g., free pizza at \[location\] on \[date\] at \[time\]\). If the student appears interested, begin to discuss the mission of the organization and your exact role. Involve the student in the conversation by asking questions, such as asking what their major is. Integrate their major into the discussion by detailing how the student can contribute to your organization and why they should attend your event. Remember to encourage the student and center your focus on them as an individual to increase engagement.

Although tabling can be discouraging at times, the few that are interested are worth the wait as they are usually the ones that remain committed to your organization.

### Utilizing the CS Department

The computer science department has access to all the students’ emails. Communicate to faculty in the department and present your workshop idea to them. Ask them to send out a major-wide email to the students that they have access to, as it will reach a much wider audience in a quicker amount of time. Make sure that you give them the correct information to email. It is best to already have a clear-cut blurb of the event that the staff can send out right away.

Professors also have the same range of access, but only with their own students. Reach out and give information to professors with the same procedure written above. Students are more likely to read through messages that are sent from either the department itself or from their professors.

### Social Media

As social media is a prominent part of students’ lives, it is a great idea to utilize this platform. Create digital flyers that advertise your event. \(A quick and easy website for creating flyers is Canva.com.\) Post on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat with a caption that includes a short, clear introduction of the organization followed by any necessary details in regards to the event.

### Incentives

* Having an incentive will encourage students to attend the event. A popular motive is food. Advertising that you have free food \(and of course, actually having the food\) will greatly increase the number of attendees in the future. 

## Presentation Tips

### Dry Runs

Prior to the event, rehearse the presentation several times. Doing this will allow you to pinpoint your mistakes and make any necessary adjustments. Have friends sit in the audience and provide feedback on your presentation. Practicing your presentation will only make your delivery sound more natural on the day of the event.

It is ideal to practice in the environment that you will be presenting the actual event. However, if the room is not available for a full rehearsal of the presentation, practicing in an equally serious environment is advised.

### Public Speaking Tips

#### Setting an Agenda

Have the event follow a clear-cut, step-by-step agenda to avoid any confusion and chaos. This will help you stay on schedule while presenting and remind you of what will come next.

#### Practice, Practice, Practice:

Repetition is key to getting rid of nerves. With more practice, the more comfortable you become with the material and the more confidence you gain. On the day of the presentation, the words will come easily and it will be a smooth process.

#### Voice and Hand Gestures:

Project your voice to ensure that everyone in the room can hear you clearly. If this is difficult for you, practice speaking loudly until it becomes easier to do or utilize the sound system. Hand gestures capture attention when used effectively; use them to emphasize certain points.
