# Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the modules that we are planning. We are planning on covering a myriad of technical topics in computer science, and for each topics we will have modules that dive deep into topics. Modules are meant to be completed in 1-3 weeks, and each module's length is covered in the road map.

We recognize that there exists a huge variety of technical interests in our Bit community and the open-source community at large. We always strive to provide the best educational content.

If you are part of Bit Project and have a new topic or module you would like to explore, or are looking to join Bit Project and have a burning interest in a certain topic, please continue reading to contribute towards our road map, and in turn, the topics we develop for next.
