# Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the modules that we are planning. We are planning on covering a myriad of technical topics in computer science, and for each topics we will have modules that dive deep into topics. Modules are meant to be completed in 1-3 weeks, and each module's length is covered in the road map.

We recognize that there exists a huge variety of technical interests in our Bit community and the open-source community at large. We always strive to provide the best educational content.

If you are part of Bit Project and have a new topic or module you would like to explore, or are looking to join Bit Project and have a burning interest in a certain topic, please continue reading to contribute towards our road map, and in turn, the topics we develop for next.

## Current Topics in Focus

Currently our teams are focused on creating interactive content for front-end and back-end development. Each topic is separated into a set of modules that they are creating content for. The categories and topics of focus can be found here.

Developers at Bit should choose a **category to develop for**, based on their interest.

#### **Front-End Development**

This category is being handled by our DevRel manager, Atul Jayaram.

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* React Native \(not currently in our road-map\)
* GraphQL
* Static Site Generators 

#### Back-end Development

This category is being handled by our DevRel manager, Taimur Kashif.

* SQL/SQLAlchemy
