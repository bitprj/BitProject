# Roadmap Topic Breakdown

## Topic: NoSQL/MongoDB

**Module: Intro to NoSQL/MongoDB**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will learn the advantages of using a NoSQL database.
* Students will learn how to utilize MongoDB's Stitch and Atlas platforms to their advantage.
* Students will learn how to set up a MongoDB database.
* Students will learn how to lookup files/data in their databases.
* Students will learn how to manipulate their data in their databases and create relationships in their databases.

_**Activities**_

* My Favorite Foods
  * You will write a Node.js program that creates and populates a MongoDB database with your favorite foodâ€™s recipe. Students will also use Stitch to make a alternative verison of the original(showcasing the time saved if they had used Stitch).
* I Feel Like Eating This Today
  * You will write a Node.js program that searches for a specific recipe in your Food database.
* Changing Taste
  * You will write a Node.js program that updates your database with new recipes and removes some old ones. You will also put your foods into different categories\(using an MongoDB's ORM\). They will also utilize MongoDB Atlas to move this database to the cloud!
* Too Much Flour
  * You will write a Node.js program that returns the average amount of flour used in your recipes\(which are in your cloud-based database\).

_**Labs**_

* Tweet Up 
  * You are going to write a program that populates a MongoDB database with the tweets of your favorite user and organizes them into different groups using statistics like how many people retweeted a specific tweet and etc. You must use MongoDB's Atlas(for cloud support) and Stitch(for ease of use) for this lab.
* Simple Pokemon Battle
  * You are going to write a program that sets up a MongoDB database with a couple of Pokemon\(grouping them by type\) and makes two random Pokemon fight!
* GutenBooks
  * You are going to write a program that asks a website\(like Project Gutenberg\) for a list of books in its catalog. Then you will store them into your database and sort them by genre.
