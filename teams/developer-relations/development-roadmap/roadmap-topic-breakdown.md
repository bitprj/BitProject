# Roadmap Topic Breakdown

**Topic: Flask**

**Module: Python Flask**

_**Learning Objectives:**_

* Students will learn the purpose and basics of Python Flask.
* Students will learn how to route different pages within their applications using Flask.
* Students will gain experience with structuring different CRUD operations.
* Students will use Flask-RESTful to structure their routes for RESTful APIs.

_**Activities:**_

* Flask Intro
  * Since Flask can be difficult to set up, the first activity will cover the basic intro to Flask to get the students going.
* Portfolio Site
  * Students will learn how to route pages using Flask by building a simple portfolio site and routing the different pages together \(Home, About Me, Resume, etc.\)
* Book Tracker
  * Students will use Postman to test CRUD endpoints that they created using Flask and Flask-RESTFUL using a list of books.
* Making Users Active
  * Students will learn the concept of Flask session by creating simple endpoints that makes a user active, returns JSON data of the active user, and deactivates a user.

_**Labs:**_

* Recipe Application
  * Students will be provided with a native dictionary of recipes in their application, and use Flask and Flask-RESTful to create endpoints to create, remove, and edit the recipes.
* Tic Tac Toe Game:
  * Students will store a tic tac toe game in a 2D array and build out a Flask endpoint that allows the user to specify the shape of their marker and place where to put their marker; the app should display the game board and indicate when a certain user has won.

## 

**Topic: Python**

**Module: Intermediate Python**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will continue applying their fundamental Python skills learned from the previous module.
* Students will begin learning about how to integrate basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to add complexity to their Python code.
* Students will learn how they can use for/while loops and if statements to control the flow of their code.
* Students will learn how to represent strings in Python using F-strings.

_**Activities**_

* Bookkeeper
  * You will write a program that reads and parses a list of Dewey decimal numbers and match it to the correct genre based on the number and then find the distribution of each genre.
* Creating a Menu
  * You will write a simple menu program which prints a menu and behaves according to user input.
* Message Cipher
  * Encode user input with both a Caesar Cipher and a Symmetric Cipher.

_**Labs**_

* Word Translation Calculator
  * You are going to write a program that calculates how often a word appears in a given string.
* Basic Calculator
  * Create a functional calculator in python that can do simple arithmetic operations on two numbers.
* Tic-Tac-Toe
  * Write a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and you will play against an AI which chooses random moves.
