# Roadmap Topic Breakdown

## Topic: Python

**Module: Intermediate Python**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will continue applying their fundamental Python skills learned from the previous module.
* Students will begin learning about how to integrate basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to add complexity to their Python code.
* Students will learn how they can use for/while loops and if statements to control the flow of their code.
* Students will learn how to represent strings in Python using F-strings.

_**Activities**_

* Bookkeeper
  * You will write a program that reads and parses a list of Dewey decimal numbers and match it to the correct genre based on the number and then find the distribution of each genre.
* Creating a Menu
  * You will write a simple menu program which prints a menu and behaves according to user input.
* Message Cipher
  * Encode user input with both a Caesar Cipher and a Symmetric Cipher.

_**Labs**_

* Word Translation Calculator
  * You are going to write a program that calculates how often a word appears in a given string.
* Basic Calculator
  * Create a functional calculator in python that can do simple arithmetic operations on two numbers.
* Tic-Tac-Toe
  * Write a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and you will play against an AI which chooses random moves.



## Topic: APIs

**Module: API Concepts**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will learn the basic concepts behind APIs, why they are used, the idea behind their functionality, etc
* Students will understand CRUD operations
* Students will learn HTTP Methods and Endpoints
* Students will understand JSON data 

_**Activities**_

* What is an API?
  *  Introduce what an api is, possibly ask students to come up with their own possible uses of APIs, introduce vocabulary like client and server, etc. 
* CRUD Operations
  * Students will learn how to use CRUD operations through a basic concrete example such as a notes app
* Into to HTTP Requests and Responses - RESTful APIs
  * Students will learn what you need to make a basic request: Url, Method, Headers, and Body as well as a basic response: status code, headers, and body 
* Data Formatting with JSON
  * Students will learn keys and values through examples such as a pizza order and how to use these formats with HTTP
* API Authentication
  * Students will learn how to use authentication for apis such as API keys

_**Labs**_

* Weather Application
  * students will use a simple weather API to create a weather app. They can use their basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and other backend resources
* Notes Application
  * similar to weather application lab, but instead students can create an application to keep notes on

_\*\*\*\*_

#### Module: Testing APIs with Postman

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will learn how to use Postman in order to test API requests and why this is useful to developers
* Understand Postman Collections and Collection Runner
* Understand Postman Mock Servers
* Learn Postman Documentation

_**Activities**_

* Testing APIs
  * Simplify/adjust the creating and testing bitbloxs in order to teach students the basics of how to run requests through postman
* Creating Postman Collections
  * We can adjust the activity that was already made for postman in order to teach students how to create collections, import collections, and create documentation. 
* Postman Collection Runner
  * Students will learn how to use the postman collection runner, either through bitblocks or through a new API
* Mock Servers
  * Adjust the current mock servers actvitiy so that student can learn about postman's Mock Servers 
* Postman Documentation
  * Adjust the already existing activity to teach students how to make documentation in postman

_**Labs**_

* NASA API
  * Adjust the activity APIs for front end developers in order to create a lab where students create a more indepth website using NASA's API
* BitBloxs
  * Use Postman to play the bitbloxs game
