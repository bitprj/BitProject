* Clouds in the Cloud
  * You will write a Node.js program using the Express.js library to create a dynamic webpage (showcasing different types of cloud types and their descriptions\) using the PUG template engine\(and with some CSS magic\) and different sub/child pages.
* California Scrapbook
  * You will write a Node.js program using the Express.js library to create a dynamic webpage\(with jQuery elements to spice things up\) that showcases the student’s favorite top ten places in California\(they must store \[and query\] this information in a MongoDB database\).
* Your Local Weather Channel
  * You will write a Node.js program using the Express.js library to create a dynamic webpage that outputs the local weather\(using their own data\) in JSON.
