# Roadmap Topic Breakdown

## Topic: Python

**Module: Intermediate Python**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will continue applying their fundamental Python skills learned from the previous module.
* Students will begin learning about how to integrate basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to add complexity to their Python code.

_**Activities**_

* Bookkeeper
  * You will write a program that reads and parses a list of Dewey decimal numbers and match it to the correct genre based on the number and then find the distribution of each genre.
* Creating a Menu
  * You will write a simple menu program which prints a menu and behaves according to user input.
* Message Cipher
  * Encode user input with both a Caesar Cipher and a Symmetric Cipher.

_**Labs**_

* Word Translation Calculator
  * You are going to write a program that calculates how often a word appears in a given string.
* Basic Calculator
  * Create a functional calculator in python that can do simple arithmetic operations on two numbers.
* Tic-Tac-Toe
  * Write a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and you will play against an AI which chooses random moves.


## Topic: Node.JS

**Module: Intro to Node.JS**

_**Learning Objectives**_

* Students will learn the basics of writing Javascript in the context of a desktop/web app.
* Students will get exposure to synchronous and asynchronous functions, which are an integral part of Node.js.
* Students will get exposure to modularity\(i.e making functions that will be used in completely different programs\).
* Students will learn how to use the Node.js HTTP client usage.

_**Activities**_

* Search For A Word
  * You will write a program that reads and parses a file\(both synchronously and asynchronously\)  and outputs the line number\(by counting the “\n”\) of a word you pass into the function.
* Give The Robot His Brain Back
  * You will write two programs \(one acts as a base for the other, in order to teach modularity\), the second program will only run if and only if the first program is written, passed in and exported properly. 
* Wikipedia Reading
  * Use HTTP get method in order to read and output the lines of a short Wikipedia or Project GutenBerg book/article. 
* Glorified\(But Polite\) Clock
  * Use the HTTP client to make a program that outputs(on the CLI) the time\(and a greeting\) when it receives a get request.

_**Labs**_

* Random Sentence Generator
  * You are going to write a program that generates random sentences from the words the user inputs into a file.
* Pig Latin Converter
  * Create a series of small programs\(that interlink into a bigger program i.e using modularity\) that “get” words from a small wikipedia/Gutenberg article/book and output a pig latin version of it.
