# Workshop Blog: Stage 1

Please ensure you **have a solid grasp on what your idea will be** before moving on with this process.

## Week 1 of 3: Formalizing Your Idea

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/devrel-flowchart-page-3.png)

**Week 1 Checklist**

* [ ] Proposal
  * [ ] Specific Idea
  * [ ] Interactive Component
  * [ ] Code Deliverables
  * [ ] Slide Outline
  * [ ] Timing
  * [ ] Motivation Behind Project
  * [ ] Difficulty/prior experience
  * [ ] Technologies that will be used
* [ ] Complete Code Deliverables Planned for Week 1

**The code deliverables should be planned out week by week and should be the first item thought out for the proposal.** This is because the code is the most time-consuming part, and preparations should be made right away to start this process.  

The first step in creating a workshop is making a **proposal**. Your proposal must be very detailed. A guide on how to pursue a workshop idea, how to compose a proposal, as well as a template can be found here:

[Workshop Proposal Guide](../workshop-proposal-guide.md)

Using the guide above, you and your teammate will create a proposal. Here you will include the main concepts covered in the workshop, an outline of the slide breakdown and how the code elements will be presented as deliverable items. This will be covered more later, but essentially you need to cover how the code related to your concepts will be presented in the slides for every week, what we will call **code deliverables**. The proposal should be done by Friday of the first week, so over the weekend the proposal can be finalized before you begin your work. You will also need create slides that discuss the idea and motivation behind teaching the material, like the real-world applications of it. Throughout the week, the manager will be checking in to ensure it's done on time.

## Week 2 of 3: Blog Rough Draft

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/devrel-flowchart-page-4.png)

* [ ] Fully integrate manager’s feedback on Week 1
* [ ] Rough Draft of Blog on conceptual and interactive portions of workshop
  * Note that blog should cover the following general sections:
    * Idea/Motivation behind project
    * Concepts 
    * Code Walkthrough
    * Interactive Component
  * Blog should be submitted in .md format to the blogs [folder](https://github.com/bitprj/mdx-deck/tree/master/misc/blogs)
* [ ] Finish Code Deliverables for Week 2
  * [ ] Document how to replicate the running of their code in a README
  * [ ] Code should be commented in GitHub for blog viewers

You should try to be done with week one's work before moving on. This will make the rest of the process much easier, and allow you to focus on the new tasks at hand. After finalizing week one with your manager's help, you can start on the code deliverables for week two. You should execute the plan outlined in the proposal for how you will deliver code in the slides.

Additionally, each duo should begin preparing their GitHub repository through which the code will be stored. The code should be well documented and commented with explanations that relate directly to the blog post. A `README.md` file must be provided to demonstrate how workshop attendees/blog viewers can replicate the project on their own machine. 

## Week 3 of 3: Finalizing Blog

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/devrel-flowchart-page-5.png)

* [ ] Fully integrate manager’s feedback on Week 2
* [ ] Blog should be fully complete with the following information covered:
  * [ ] Idea/Motivation behind project
  * [ ] Concepts 
  * [ ] Code Walkthrough
  * [ ] Interactive Component
* [ ] Blog should be written professionally and tailored for students of your subject
  * [ ] In the blogs [folder](https://github.com/bitprj/mdx-deck/tree/master/misc/blogs)
* [ ] Finish Code Deliverables for Week 3
  * [ ] Update README based on additional code deliverables developed
  * [ ] Comment all GitHub code for readability
  * [ ] GitHub Repository completely set up for public use and linked in blog post

After finishing up week two's tasks, start on week three's code deliverables, if necessary. **Your blog should be completed by this week, covering the above sections.** Note that you should aim to make your blog as accurate as possible with regards to content and concepts. Each blog will be scrutinized by our marketing team for writing style, consistency, and marketability before publishing.

## Slide Deliverables \[OUTDATED\]

### Three-Part Delivery

The slides in the workshop will be split into three parts in order to create an informative and interactive experience for the audience, and the developer duo can use the information below to check and see if their slides are ready for slide reviews, which will be performed by the manager every week.

#### Part One: Idea/Motivation

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week One and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Two, and the final draft of these slides should be completed during Week Two and finalized during Week Three. Part One slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Clear learning objective
* [ ] Important buzz-words
* [ ] Examples and applications \(describes how far the world has come\)
* [ ] Use cases \(explains why the topic of the workshop is useful\)

#### Part Two: Concepts + Interactive Introduction

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week Two and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Three, and the final draft of these slides should be completed during Week Three and finalized during Week Four. Part Two slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Highly-developed concepts
  * [ ] Verbal descriptions \(explains the preparations behind the slides\)
  * [ ] Speaker notes \(supplements explanations given to the audience\)
* [ ] Bridge between concepts and the interactive activity
* [ ] Explanation of code's development and support
* [ ] Introduction to interactive activity

#### Part Three: Interactive Tutorial + Additional Concepts

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week Three and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Four, and the final draft of these slides should be during Week Four and finalized during by the end of Week Four, finishing the workshop. Part Three slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Ample screenshots or photos
* [ ] Clear instructions \(on the slide or verbally given\)
* [ ] Step-by-Step slides for interactive activity
* [ ] Functioning interactive activity
