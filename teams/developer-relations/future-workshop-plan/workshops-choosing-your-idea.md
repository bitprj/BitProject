**For first-timers to MDX-Deck:**

* [ ] Clone MDX-Deck [Repository](https://github.com/bitprj/mdx-deck) locally
* [ ] Navigate to local repo folder, run commands `npm install` and `npm start`
  * [ ] Check that your site is running at `localhost:8000`
* [ ] Create new .mdx file under `mdx-deck/decks` folder
  * [ ] Change this file
  * [ ] See changes in your .mdx file at `localhost:8000`

**Week 1 Checklist**

* [ ] Go through entire workshop
  * [ ] Make sure it **completely works on your computer**\* _\*\*_

* [ ] Add new interactive component
* [ ] Finalize date and time with Head
* [ ] ["General Slide Checklist"](./#general-slide-checklist) should be completed for your slides

_\*Some workshops may be outdated or incomplete. It would be up to you to coordinate with your manager to fill in the gaps._

Each duo should first convert each workshop article into slides. Detailed speaker notes should be made for all slides.

Then you should consult with your manager to formulate and come together on an idea for your new interactive component. This idea should be fully addressed in your MDX-Deck slides.

Lastly, for planning purposes, the date and time of your presentation should be finalized with the Head of DevRel.

As developers, you should fully integrate your manager's feedback on your slides for this week. While finalizing your slides, you should also convert these slides into a lab format. Please consult with your manager closely on both the slides and the lab conversion during meetings/follow-ups.

Lastly, for the presentation, speaker notes should be fully fleshed out in MDX-Deck. Please confirm your presentation time with your manager and head.

## Week 3 of 3: Presentation, Implementing Feedback
