# Slide Reviews for Managers

Throughout this process, managers will be checking in with the developer duo in weekly meetings to conduct slide reviews in order to provide support and feedback and to ensure that the workshop is ready to be presented at the end of this process.

#### Week One

Before the developer duo starts creating the slides, the manager should have checked in with the duo during the previous week to make sure that the proposal is completed or is at least close to completion. During this week, the manager will now look over the proposal to review its quality and point out any errors that may need more clarification. The manager may further discuss how to integrate ideas from the proposal into slides and personally work with the developer duo on ironing out code deliverable thorughout this process.

#### Week Two

After last week's discussion, the developer duo should have completed the first draft of Part One slides, and it will be the manager's role to arrange and perform quality assurance checks on the presentation during each weekly meeting. To know what to look for during a slide review, refer to the section above. After reviewing the slides, the manager will provide feedback by Tuesday every week and follow up again with the developer duo to check in on progress with Part Two slides. The manager should offer expertise where needed and will check in with the developer duo throughout the week to ensure that all tasks are completed at the end of the week, which will be every Sunday.

#### Week Three

By this week, the developer duo should be done with the first draft of Part Two slides and the final draft of Part One slides, so the manager will finalize the Part One slides by fixing any last-minute overlooked errors and ambiguities and review Part Two slides by providing feedback. The manager should also determine checkpoints and concepts for the workshop's lab conversion in Part Three slides during this week, as well as be following up with the developer duo frequently to make sure that they are working at a good pace and thoroughly understand their material for their workshop.

#### Week Four

For the final week, the developer duo should be finished with the first draft of Part Three slides and the final draft of Part Two slides. The manager will finalize Part Two slides, and to perform a quality assurance check on Part Three slides, the manger should ensure checkpoint and concepts, run through the lab to check that the lac is completely functional, and raise any potential questions that students may have while interacting with the lab. By the end of this week, the workshop should be completely finalized and ready to be presented.
