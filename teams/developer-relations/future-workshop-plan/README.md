# Future Workshop Plan

## Introduction 

Workshops are Bit Project's next endeavor in our efforts to democratize technical education. Up until now, we've been working on Labs and Activities, but we want to begin the shift to a more exciting and interactive way of teaching. We will be creating presentations to teach students through a live workshop at the end of the workshop cycle. 

### Why Workshops?

The hope is that workshops will be a more hands-on, purposeful method of both teaching and learning. On the development and teaching end, we will get the opportunity to curate a project that we are personally interested in along with a partner who is equally engaged with the material. For students, the learning process will be visual and engaging, including a chance to apply newly learned skills in a fun way. 

### Contributing to Workshops 

#### Teams

Within our current teams, we will pair up with another team member based on a shared interest in a topic. We will get a list of topics we are interested in, and each choose what we think is exciting. This is will ensure you are working with someone who will be equally as enthusiastic about the subject matter. Then, you will collaborate to create a proposal of how you will present the topic to students, and eventually create an entire workshop together.

#### Workshop Components 

There will be two versions of every workshop: slides and labs. The labs are similar to what we've already been working on. This time, though, we will be creating the presentation slides first, and then converting them into labs. This will help foster the excitement for developers, since the presentation is what we will be directly involved with. Presentations will be around 90 minutes long, so there should be enough slides to cover the material in-depth. The slides will include a general overview of the concept and then an interactive activity the students will participate in. Then, the labs are created so online access is available later. 

#### Roles

Within each pairing, there will be designated roles for both partners. One person will be the **Development Coordinator**. This person might have more knowledge on the topic, and as such they will be in charge of the main concepts behind the workshop. They will create an overall plan for the curriculum and outline what exactly will be taught in the workshop. The **Workshop Developer** will also help form the workshop plan, but their main role will be executing and building upon the workshop plan. This will include making slides \(and the associated lab\) and expanding on concepts. Both team members will play an equal role in the development of the workshop and will take suggestions from each other to make improvements as necessary. The Development Coordinator should be there to answer content questions the Workshop Developer may have, as well as be available to explain specifics of the workshop outline. 

## What are you delivering?

1. MDX-Deck presentation slides
2. Lab converted from slides
3. A live presentation 

Your presentation slides should be in MDX-Deck format. Documentation can be found here: \[TO BE DONE\]

During the preparation of your slides, you will also work with your partner to create a lab out of your workshop.

At the end of each cycle, you will hold a presentation for your manager and everyone in Bit.

## Process

The entire process can be found in this flow chart:

![Workshop Development Process](../../../.gitbook/assets/workshop-flowchart-page-1-2.png)

This flow chart will be explained in the following sections. 

### Starting Out

![Flowchart for Starting Out](../../../.gitbook/assets/workshop-flowchart-page-2%20%281%29.jpeg)

* [ ] Form duos
* [ ] Pick Topic
* [ ] Decide whether to choose existing idea \(3 weeks\) or pursue original idea \(5 weeks\)

You and your partner must decide on a topic. Please consult our [roadmap](../development-roadmap/#current-topics-in-focus) for the current topics we are covering.

Also, each duo must decide whether they would like to pursue an workshop idea. By default, you can choose an idea from our pre-compiled list on Airtable. Please ask a manager to share the Airtable with you.

### General Slide Checklist

After looking into the specific requirements for the content of each individual part of the workshop, here are some requirements that all of the slides should fulfill **every week**:

* [ ] Precise headers
* [ ] Appropriate formatting 
* [ ] Correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation
* [ ] Consise text \(includes clear descriptions without tangents\)
* [ ] Smooth transitions \(includes references to previous slides, if needed\)
* [ ] Consistent pacing \(includes significant and meaningful content\)

### Choosing an Idea

If you _choose an idea_, your duo will follow a **3 week process** to prepare your deliverables.

## Slide Reviews

### Manager's Role

Throughout this process, managers will be checking in with the developer duo in weekly meetings to conduct slide reviews in order to provide support and feedback and to ensure that the workshop is ready to be presented at the end of this process.

#### Week One

Before the developer duo starts creating the slides, the manager should have checked in with the  duo during the previous week to make sure that the proposal is completed or is at least close to completion. During this week, the manager will now look over the proposal to review its quality and point out any errors that may need more clarification. The manager may further discuss how to integrate ideas from the proposal into slides and personally work with the developer duo on ironing out code deliverable thorughout this process.

#### Week Two

After last week's discussion, the developer duo should have completed the first draft of Part One slides, and it will be the manager's role to arrange and perform quality assurance checks on the presentation during each weekly meeting. To know what to look for during a slide review, refer to the section above. After reviewing the slides, the manager will provide feedback by Tuesday every week and follow up again with the developer duo to check in on progress with Part Two slides. The manager should offer expertise where needed and will check in with the developer duo throughout the week to ensure that all tasks are completed at the end of the week, which will be every Sunday.

#### Week Three

By this week, the developer duo should be done with the first draft of Part Two slides and the final draft of Part One slides, so the manager will finalize the Part One slides by fixing any last-minute overlooked errors and ambiguities and review Part Two slides by providing feedback. The manager should also determine checkpoints and concepts for the workshop's lab conversion in Part Three slides during this week, as well as be following up with the developer duo frequently to make sure that they are working at a good pace and thoroughly understand their material for their workshop.

#### Week Four

For the final week, the developer duo should be finished with the first draft of Part Three slides and the final draft of Part Two slides. The manager will finalize Part Two slides, and to perform a quality assurance check on Part Three slides, the manger should ensure checkpoint and concepts, run through the lab to check that the lac is completely functional, and raise any potential questions that students may have while interacting with the lab. By the end of this week, the workshop should be completely finalized and ready to be presented.



### How to Convert Workshops into Labs

#### For Developers:

Converting a workshop into a lab will be similar to the process of making any lab, and thus will follow the usual guidelines for lab making. This section will discuss the differences in creating labs from workshops rather than scratch. Keep in mind that every workshop is different, which means the lab process may be unique to the workshop. However, these are the general guidelines to follow. 

The lab should replicate the interactive section of the workshop. Because of this, most likely there will not be a need for easy or medium cards for these labs. Other than that, all general items for labs/activities, as they are specified in this bible, still apply. For stage 1, starting content still applies. Keep in mind for many workshops there will probably be starter code for the students. The lab is supposed to be the workshop, not explanations of the code behind it. This code should be given. Stage 2, finishing content, still applies, however there may not be as many auto-grader checkpoints depending on the nature of the workshop. Stage 3 also fully applies. 

Most of the cards, checkpoints, and concepts can simply be more in-depth explanations of the workshop slides. For example, if you have a slide which asks the audience a question, this may be turned into a short answer checkpoint. 

#### For Managers:

Remember that you only have one week to have the lab completely finished. As always, you should have a plan in place to do so!

At the beginning of week 4, managers should delegate specific tasks to every team member so that all parts of the lab will be completed. These tasks, just like a regular lab, include:

* cards \(content\) 
* concepts - should follow the concepts mentioned in the workshop
* checkpoints - may or may not be auto-grader checkpoints, depending on the hands-on part of the workshop
* formatting \(READMEs, hints, concepts, checkpoints\)

Besides the usual reviewing done for content quality, managers should closely monitor the parts of the lab which are easily overlooked such as concept creation, checkpoints, and proper formatting. Make sure these tasks are properly assigned to a developer and that these developers understand the process of these tasks, especially formatting.

Formatting is often confusing to developers who have never done it before, so please ensure that whoever implements formatting is well guided. This includes READMEs and hints. Checkpoints and concepts similarly are often overlooked or done incorrectly, and both require a lot of specific formatting as well. 



## **Guide on how to pursue an idea for a workshop**

With the rapid advancements in industrial applications of software engineering and software developers, it has become necessary that teaching and learning methods are also updated in a way that will help students both in theory and practical industry applications. \(Extra\)

The structure of our workshops will focus on understanding fundamental concepts of modern software development and use those concepts in projects. Before building an application, it is important to understand some important the basic tools and how they can be used. Your team should work on using the provided libraries creatively and affectively. The workshops will be divided into five categories. Each category is a project on its own dives into specific fields such as:

* Web Development \(Django, Flask,socket\)
* Data science/visualization \( Matplotlib, Seaborn\),
* Desktop GUI \(Tkinter, PyQt\)
* Web scraping \(Selenium, BeautifulSoup\)
* Game Development \(pygame, PySoy\)

Since projects will emphasis on building products or services that can have real-life applications. Some examples, are:

* Financial Applications:
  * A stock market watching app
* Information app:
  * Build a 1-page news app, that gets the top stories from 3 favorite technology newspapers.
* Healthcare:
  * Build an only doctor to patient video call app.
* Social Media:
  * Chat application.
* Security:
  * Deep fake image detector

Your team is not required to finish the whole project during the workshop. The goal of these workshops is for students to be able to use the libraries and frameworks to develop a basic representation of their idea but more importantly to be able to recreate the basic concepts of those ideas in the respective category they choose. If students have an ambitious goal, our goal is to break the idea down into the first basic presentable form of the idea.

## **Guide on how to code review**

**Why, what and when to do code reviews?**

It is important to understand **why** we are doing code reviews, while programming it is very easy to type out bugs due to the fast implementation and abstract thinking. Therefore, passing our code through a process of code reviews can lead to a consistent, legible code and also remove accidental errors made.

**What?**  
For your projects you will be dividing your architecture into independent parts before integrating them into a functioning application. Therefore, it in necessary to be able to execute independent portions step by step for example in web development, we must be able to make sure our server is running an functional which is the first step, the second test will be testing the functioning of the web framework that we use \(e.g Flask or Django\).

**When?**  
Code reviews should be conducted before merging into the main branch and after all automatic checks \(tests, styles, other CI\).

While students are conducting code reviews, they should keep the following points in mind:

* Is the system design interlinked?
* Are there any independent tests than be conducted to verify components of the system architecture?
