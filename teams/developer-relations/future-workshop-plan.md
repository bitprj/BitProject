# Future Workshop Plan

## Introduction 

Workshops are Bit Project's next endeavor in our efforts to democratize technical education. Up until now, we've been working on Labs and Activities, but we want to begin the shift to a more exciting and interactive way of teaching. We will be creating presentations to teach students through a live workshop at the end of the workshop cycle. 

### Why Workshops?

The hope is that workshops will be a more hands-on, purposeful method of both teaching and learning. On the development and teaching end, we will get the opportunity to curate a project that we are personally interested in along with a partner who is equally engaged with the material. For students, the learning process will be visual and engaging, including a chance to apply newly learned skills in a fun way. 

### Contributing to Workshops 

#### Teams

Within our current teams, we will pair up with another team member based on a shared interest in a topic. We will get a list of topics we are interested in, and each choose what we think is exciting. This is will ensure you are working with someone who will be equally as enthusiastic about the subject matter. Then, you will collaborate to create a proposal of how you will present the topic to students, and eventually create an entire workshop together.

#### Workshop Components 

There will be two versions of every workshop: slides and labs. The labs are similar to what we've already been working on. This time, though, we will be creating the presentation slides first, and then converting them into labs. This will help foster the excitement for developers, since the presentation is what we will be directly involved with. Presentations will be around 90 minutes long, so there should be enough slides to cover the material in-depth. The slides will include a general overview of the concept and then an interactive activity the students will participate in. Then, the labs are created so online access is available later. 

#### Roles

Within each pairing, there will be designated roles for both partners. One person will be the **Development Coordinator**. This person might have more knowledge on the topic, and as such they will be in charge of the main concepts behind the workshop. They will create an overall plan for the curriculum and outline what exactly will be taught in the workshop. The **Workshop Developer** will also help form the workshop plan, but their main role will be executing and building upon the workshop plan. This will include making slides \(and the associated lab\) and expanding on concepts. Both team members will play an equal role in the development of the workshop and will take suggestions from each other to make improvements as necessary. The Development Coordinator should be there to answer content questions the Workshop Developer may have, as well as be available to explain specifics of the workshop outline. 

The first step in creating a workshop is making a **proposal**. Here is a guide on how to pursue a workshop idea:

[Workshop Proposal Guide](workshop-proposal-guide.md)

## Process

### Four-Week Stage

The workshops will be created over a month-long period. Each week there will be new goals that help you complete the workshop by the end of the cycle. 

#### Week One: Proposal and Idea Slides

Using the guide above, you and your teammate will create a proposal. Here you will include the main concepts covered in the workshop, an outline of the slide breakdown and how the code elements will be presented as deliverable items. This will be covered more later, but essentially you need to cover how the code related to your concepts will be presented in the slides for every week, what we will call **code deliverables**. The proposal should be done by Friday of the first week, so over the weekend the proposal can be finalized before you begin your work. You will also need create slides that discuss the idea and motivation behind teaching the material, like the real-world applications of it. Throughout the week, the manager will be checking in to ensure it's done on time.

#### Week Two: Finalizing Week One and Creating Concept Slides

You should try to be done with week one's work before moving on. This will make the rest of the process much easier, and allow you to focus on the new tasks at hand. After finalizing week one with your manager's help, you can start on the code deliverables for week two. You should execute the plan outlined in the proposal for how you will deliver code in the slides. This week's slides \(and code deliverables\) should relate to the main concept you cover in the workshop. This is the bulk of the content related to your main topic. Then, you should work on some slides that introduce the interactive component of the workshop.

#### Week Three: Finalizing Week Two and Creating Interactive Component

After finishing up week two slides, start on week three's code deliverables, if necessary. The recommended workflow for code deliverables is being done by week two, but if it takes until week three that is okay. Then you want to complete the interactive slides. These will apply the concepts from week two's slides to some sort of activity for the students, so make sure it's made clear that this is the goal of this part of the presentation \(applying the new skills\). Any additional components that weren't covered in week two's slides can also be added here. 

#### Week Four: Finalizing 

If there are more code deliverables to be completed, make sure they are done this week. Other than that, this week is for finishing up week three's work, and reviewing the overall presentation. Check for spelling, grammar, clarity of ideas, images needed, code deliverables, and any other aspect of the presentation that needs to be edited. Lastly, you will develop a plan for how the slides will be converted into a lab. This only needs to be a summary of that process.

## Slide Deliverables

### Three-Part Delivery

The slides in the workshop will be split into three parts in order to create an informative and interactive experience for the audience, and the developer duo can use the information below to check and see if their slides are ready for slide reviews, which will be performed by the manager every week. 

#### Part One: Idea/Motivation

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week One and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Two, and the final draft of these slides should be completed during Week Two and finalized during Week Three. Part One slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Clear learning objective
* [ ] Important buzz-words
* [ ] Examples and applications \(describes how far the world has come\)
* [ ] Use cases \(explains why the topic of the workshop is useful\)

#### Part Two: Concepts + Interactive Introduction

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week Two and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Three, and the final draft of these slides should be completed during Week Three and finalized during Week Four. Part Two slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Highly-developed concepts
  * [ ] Verbal descriptions \(explains the preparations behind the slides\)
  * [ ] Speaker notes \(supplements explanations given to the audience\)
* [ ] Bridge between concepts and the interactive activity
* [ ] Explanation of code's development and support
* [ ] Introduction to interactive activity

#### Part Three: Interactive Tutorial + Additional Concepts

The first draft of these slides must be completed by the end of Week Three and reviewed by the manager at the start of Week Four, and the final draft of these slides should be during Week Four and finalized during by the end of Week Four, finishing the workshop. Part Three slides should fulfill the following:

* [ ] Ample screenshots or photos
* [ ] Clear instructions \(on the slide or verbally given\)
* [ ] Step-by-Step slides for interactive activity
* [ ] Functioning interactive activity

### General Checklist

After looking into the specific requirements for the content of each individual part of the workshop, here are some requirements that all of the slides should fulfill:

* [ ] Precise headers
* [ ] Appropriate formatting 
* [ ] Correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation
* [ ] Consise text \(includes clear descriptions without tangents\)
* [ ] Smooth transitions \(includes references to previous slides, if needed\)
* [ ] Consistent pacing \(includes significant and meaningful content\)

## Slide Reviews

### Manager's Role

Throughout this process, managers will be checking in with the developer duo in weekly meetings to conduct slide reviews in order to provide support and feedback and to ensure that the workshop is ready to be presented at the end of this process.

#### Week One

Before the developer duo starts creating the slides, the manager should have checked in with the  duo during the previous week to make sure that the proposal is completed or is at least close to completion. During this week, the manager will now look over the proposal to review its quality and point out any errors that may need more clarification. The manager may further discuss how to integrate ideas from the proposal into slides and personally work with the developer duo on ironing out code deliverable thorughout this process.

#### Week Two

After last week's discussion, the developer duo should have completed the first draft of Part One slides, and it will be the manager's role to arrange and perform quality assurance checks on the presentation during each weekly meeting. To know what to look for during a slide review, refer to the section above. After reviewing the slides, the manager will provide feedback by Tuesday every week and follow up again with the developer duo to check in on progress with Part Two slides. The manager should offer expertise where needed and will check in with the developer duo throughout the week to ensure that all tasks are completed at the end of the week, which will be every Sunday.

#### Week Three

By this week, the developer duo should be done with the first draft of Part Two slides and the final draft of Part One slides, so the manager will finalize the Part One slides by fixing any last-minute overlooked errors and ambiguities and review Part Two slides by providing feedback. The manager should also determine checkpoints and concepts for the workshop's lab conversion in Part Three slides during this week, as well as be following up with the developer duo frequently to make sure that they are working at a good pace and thoroughly understand their material for their workshop.

#### Week Four

For the final week, the developer duo should be finished with the first draft of Part Three slides and the final draft of Part Two slides. The manager will finalize Part Two slides, and to perform a quality assurance check on Part Three slides, the manger should ensure checkpoint and concepts, run through the lab to check that the lac is completely functional, and raise any potential questions that students may have while interacting with the lab. By the end of this week, the workshop should be completely finalized and ready to be presented.
