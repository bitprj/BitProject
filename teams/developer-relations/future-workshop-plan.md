# Future Workshop Plan

## Introduction 

Workshops are Bit Project's next endeavor in our efforts to democratize technical education. Up until now, we've been working on Labs and Activities, but we want to begin the shift to a more exciting and interactive way of teaching. We will be creating presentations to teach students through a live workshop at the end of the workshop cycle. 

### Why Workshops?

The hope is that workshops will be a more hands-on, purposeful method of both teaching and learning. On the development and teaching end, we will get the opportunity to curate a project that we are personally interested in along with a partner who is equally engaged with the material. For students, the learning process will be visual and engaging, including a chance to apply newly learned skills in a fun way. 

### Contributing to Workshops 

#### Teams

Within our current teams, we will pair up with another team member based on a shared interest in a topic. We will get a list of topics we are interested in, and each choose what we think is exciting. This is will ensure you are working with someone who will be equally as enthusiastic about the subject matter. Then, you will collaborate to create a proposal of how you will present the topic to students, and eventually create an entire workshop together.

#### Workshop Components 

There will be two versions of every workshop: slides and labs. The labs are similar to what we've already been working on. This time, though, we will be creating the presentation slides first, and then converting them into labs. This will help foster the excitement for developers, since the presentation is what we will be directly involved with. Presentations will be around 90 minutes long, so there should be enough slides to cover the material in-depth. The slides will include a general overview of the concept and then an interactive activity the students will participate in. Then, the labs are created so online access is available later. 

#### Roles

Within each pairing, there will be designated roles for both partners. One person will be the **Development Coordinator**. This person might have more knowledge on the topic, and as such they will be in charge of the main concepts behind the workshop. They will create an overall plan for the curriculum and outline what exactly will be taught in the workshop. The **Workshop Developer** will also help form the workshop plan, but their main role will be executing and building upon the workshop plan. This will include making slides \(and the associated lab\) and expanding on concepts. Both team members will play an equal role in the development of the workshop and will take suggestions from each other to make improvements as necessary. The Development Coordinator should be there to answer content questions the Workshop Developer may have, as well as be available to explain specifics of the workshop outline. 

The first step in creating a workshop is making a **proposal**. Here is a guide on how to pursue a workshop idea:

## Process

### Four-Week Stage

The workshops will be created over a month-long period. Each week there will be new goals that help you complete the workshop by the end of the cycle. 

#### Week One: Proposal and Idea Slides

Using the guide above, you and your teammate will create a proposal. Here you will include the main concepts covered in the workshop, an outline of the slide breakdown and how the code elements will be presented as deliverable items. This will be covered more later, but essentially you need to cover how the code related to your concepts will be presented in the slides for every week, what we will call **code deliverables**. The proposal should be done by Friday of the first week, so over the weekend the proposal can be finalized before you begin your work. You will also need create slides that discuss the idea and motivation behind teaching the material, like the real-world applications of it. Throughout the week, the manager will be checking in to ensure it's done on time.

#### Week Two: Finalizing Week One and Creating Concept Slides

You should try to be done with week one's work before moving on. This will make the rest of the process much easier, and allow you to focus on the new tasks at hand. After finalizing week one with your manager's help, you can start on the code deliverables for week two. You should execute the plan outlined in the proposal for how you will deliver code in the slides. This week's slides \(and code deliverables\) should relate to the main concept you cover in the workshop. This is the bulk of the content related to your main topic. Then, you should work on some slides that introduce the interactive component of the workshop.

#### Week Three: Finalizing Week Two and Creating Interactive Component

After finishing up week two slides, start on week three's code deliverables, if necessary. The recommended workflow for code deliverables is being done by week two, but if it takes until week three that is okay. Then you want to complete the interactive slides. These will apply the concepts from week two's slides to some sort of activity for the students, so make sure it's made clear that this is the goal of this part of the presentation \(applying the new skills\). Any additional components that weren't covered in week two's slides can also be added here. 

#### Week Four: Finalizing 

If there are more code deliverables to be completed, make sure they are done this week. Other than that, this week is for finishing up week three's work, and reviewing the overall presentation. Check for spelling, grammar, clarity of ideas, images needed, code deliverables, and any other aspect of the presentation that needs to be edited. Lastly, you will develop a plan for how the slides will be converted into a lab. This only needs to be a summary of that process.
