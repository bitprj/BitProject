# Workshop Proposal Guide

Your proposal is the framework of your workshop. Although it doesn't need to include every word of the presentation, it should reflect a lot of thought about your project. The stronger your proposal, the easier the workshop creation process will be. 

## Creating the Proposal

### Forming Your Idea

The first point you want to make is how you will be teaching your concept. So, after picking a topic to teach, you and your partner should discuss the different ways it can be taught. If there are sub-areas of the topic, decide if you can teach them all or if you should narrow it down and focus on one element. You should come up with a specific idea, or even a title for the presentation, that you will be teaching. 

### Code Deliverables

Next, you want to figure out your **code deliverables**. This is all the code that you will include the in the slides. You don't want to overwhelm students with code-heavy slides, so you have to think about how to break up your code into digestible pieces. You also want to develop a week-by-week plan for when you will have the code completed by. This will help you pace yourself with the code you need to write for the workshop. 

### Slide Outline

You will want to create an outline for the slides in your presentation. You don't need to write up every slide yet, but you should have an idea for what needs to be physically on the slides and how the content will be broken down, just like the code deliverables. You also want to have an idea how many slides you will need and where the code will fit into it. This isn't a rulebook â€” if you need to add or remove along the way, that's okay. You just want to have a guide for you, your teammate and your manager. Again, the more detailed the proposal, the less work you'll have down the line.

### Interactive Component 

This is the coolest part of the workshop! Here, you and your partner get creative freedom for how you would like to apply your topic to an activity. It can be as simple as having them code what you've taught them in a specific way or with a specific goal. You can also turn it into a game, where different aspects of the code get them points. There are some example presentations you can refer to with examples of how other developers have implemented the interactive component. Be sure to include in the proposal how this section will directly teach or apply the recently learned skills.

### Timing

Remember, the presentations will be from 90 minutes to two hours, including the interactive section, so be sure to gauge how much time you dedicate to teaching versus the activity. A good amount the time should be allocated to students interacting with the material, and you don't want to bore them by talking for too long. Make sure to leave time for questions. You should decide how much time each component takes, and provide an estimate for the length of the presentation \(this is subject to change, but try to guess\). Be sure to think about how you would want to learn as a student. Would you rather be listening or applying your new skills? 

### General Presentation Goals

You want to make sure the students know why they are there \(and that the manager knows why\). Your proposal should include what the students should be walking away with, meaning the actual code and any lessons about coding/your topic that are important \(i.e. anyone can code!\). You also want to make clear what technologies they will be using, as well as general terms to know before getting into the workshop. If there are key words or general concepts they should know beforehand, make a slide or two dedicated to background so everyone is on the same page. Moreover, include difficulty and prior experience necessary for the workshop, so no one is too confused. Lastly, make sure the students care about the material. Why is it important that they know it? How is it applied in the real world? Include how you'll relay this in the presentation.
